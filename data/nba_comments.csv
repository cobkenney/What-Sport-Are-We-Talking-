But it is obvious that his most memorable moments came during the 2015 Finals, when he reentered the starting lineup to beat the LeBron led Cavs.

Overall, I think because of how special this run was, I can get retiring his number.

In baseball they have 40 man rosters. In the NFL players are limited to what numbers they can wear based on their position so you can't really go about retiring a bunch of RB's and LB's and still have enough left for a 52 man roster.

Coupled with heavy substance abuse, these feelings of inadequacy quickly spiraled into a deep depression. Craig ""The Leg"" Sager assured him that his anatomy was absolutely not the norm, and Rodman should feel nothing but proud of his manhood and many accolades, effectively lifting his spirits.",comment

Also seems like when the masses don't like you they love to say such and such relies on athleticism. No shit it's the nba every player would be different if they were a little slower or less explosive But the truly truly great ahtletes remain ahtletic and guess what they also have skill.

LordWallace232,et6lmji,t3_ca8b1q,nba,"It's not that he's not good, or even not great.

The first year or two should be okay but then he's getting into his mid 30s, and the contract is just getting more and more expensive

There are some mildly worrying signs about his rim attacking worries which will become a big problem if he can't bounce back from last year's shooting slump.


Edit: The Zach Lowe's of the world? You mean the guys who know way more about basketball than you do and literally watch it for a living? All you're trying to say is 'nerdz bad'.

Do you really think that's true?  He's alienated every other great teammate he's ever played with to the point of them doing anything to no longer have to play with him.  He's a great player, but carries the dual tax of being completely blind to his own limitations around his lack of crunch-time judgement (fucking regrettable weakness for an ostensible PG) , and having a team-crippling albatross of a supermax deal.  

You can't build around him because other great players can't stand actually playing with him (regardless of what initial lip service they give in the honeymoon phase) and because he cripples your salary cap flexibility.  You also don't want him to be the dude that your young guys learn from.",comment
MantisTobogganMD2,et6ne2a,t3_ca8b1q,nba,"Counting stats don‚Äôt mean a ton. He shot something like 29% from 3 last year on 7 attempts per game, which is extremely harmful. He‚Äôs also getting to the line less than ever before (4 fewer FTA/game than 2 years ago), which is a terrible sign, and his FT% went down inexplicably. Everyone can see his raw counting stats are due to his insane usage and the Thunder‚Äôs system of having their bigs box guys out but not go for rebounds themselves.

He‚Äôs still a good player, but he‚Äôs a fringe all star who is being paid like a superstar.",comment

If it was 2016 Westbrook then yes but it's not, he had an injury and his shot has gone missing, he can't even shoot free throws like he used to

rhythmicjoy,et6s9vc,t3_ca8b1q,nba," this analysis suffers from, like, a reverse recency bias.

jwong63,et7kqee,t3_ca8b1q,nba,"I think you've overlooked a few facts:

The ""27"" points are terribly inefficient

He gives up on the defensive end

&amp;#x200B;

There's a reason why no teammate has ever been able to be successful with him.  There's a reason why Oladipo looked like garbage in OKC and is suddenly a star in Indiana.  There's a reason why PG couldn't even pull it off with him in the end.

SurprizeBigSize,et6vb9w,t3_ca8b1q,nba,Yeah but stat padded stats don't mean much. His endurance is impressive but he's been stat padding for the last 3 seasons.

I really like the addition of horford. He can really help with embiid‚Äôs minutes and help him develop his old man game, that he inevitably needs to do to stay on the court.

I like the addition, by subtraction, of getting rid of jimmy buckets. Dude is a cancer to any team and I think they are better off without him.

Losing reddick hurts, but I think Tobias will only continue to get better.

I think the sixers main problem is the Ben Simmons contract. Simmons is trash. A point guard who can‚Äôt shoot and sucks in the half court. He is great in transition, but terrible when the game slows down. That contract will haunt you guys.

-peace out from LA",comment

moorescore,et7h3w5,t3_caa6ip,nba,"I also am a Blazer fan. I love that he's ultra competitive, and doesn't back down from any smack talk. However, his play style just isn't great in this league right now. I am struggling to word how to say it, but I honestly don't feel with the way he plays now any team he is on will win a ship. Yes, he averages a triple double, 10+ assists a game, but he doesn't make people around him all that better like other great superstars. Even though he averages that many assists a game, he is still selfish when it comes to crunch time. That wouldn't even be a problem if he was more efficient. My memory is sorta evading me, but the WCSF against us highlighted exactly that. PG13 had something like 30+ points on crazy shooting efficiency, and what does Westbrook do with the game on the line in the last couple minutes? Bricks a pull up ugly ass midrange, misses a layup and then turns the ball over. I don't remember if PG got a shot up in the last couple minutes of that game, but regardless he didn't get enough and that was one of the reasons they lost that series in 5 games. IF he were to become more generous and efficient with the ball, especially in situations like that, then I think more people would be in awe of his overall play (as if averaging a triple double doesn't already do that).",comment

Like it is insanely difficult to get 10 of anything in the league and he averages a triple double.

They just don‚Äôt like it because he is a guard getting the same easy rebounds centers usually get by default.

But dude plays the game 100% every day, he is explosive and fun to watch. And he doesn‚Äôt just try to get fouled like r/nba supposedly wants.

I didn‚Äôt mind it during his MVP season because he was the best option, but when you play with KD and Paul George there is no reason to shoot 20 times a game on awful efficiency.

The hate comes when people look at him as a player analytically. He's super high volume, not all that efficient, not a good shooter, and his overaggressiveness bites him very frequently.

He's also incredibly dynamic, a great playmaker, and an all around physical presence that is very tough to deal with. I'm not gonna say ""you can't win with him"" or anything.

Ever since the 2012 season that I've been saying westbrook should've been a shooting guard and Harden should've been the one running the point, because he was always a much smarter player.

east vs west only face each other twice a season. the NBA typically saves those matchups for big dates like Christmas or later in the season when there's more interest in the NBA.

season openers are typically teams within the same conference. i just scanned all the games within the first 2 days of the season for the past 3 seasons, i think there was only like 1 out of 40 where it was an east vs west team.

also, LAC vs TOR is not that interesting of a basketball game to watch with TOR likely being an average team and LAC likely being an elite team. the NBA isn't going to open the season with that.",comment

People keep insisting on Dragic to Dallas so you could reroute him there for Courtney Lee and a pick. OKC would shed 10 million in salary and dip just below the tax line.

twistedlogicx,et7xoor,t3_cadbm4,nba,"**Transcript:**

*35 took my family and me from Seat Pleasant, MD and showed us the world.*

*35 allowed me to me to meet people that I never would've had the chance to meet, experience things I would never have had the chance to experience, and achieve things that I never would have been able to achieve.*

*35 allowed me to go to the University of Texas to play basketball. 35 allowed me to achieve my dream of playing in the NBA in Seattle.*

*35 allowed me to play basketball in Oklahoma City and form bonds and friendships that will last a lifetime.*

*Lastly, 35 allowed me to go to the Bay Area and win two championships and form brotherhoods that no time or distance will ever break.*

*35 was chosen in honor of someone very near and dear to me. I will always honor him and honor the number 35.*

*But as I start this new chapter in my basketball life, the number I'll be wearing on my back is the number 7 next time you see me on the floor.*

*One time Brooklyn.*",comment

You can clearly see those two years where MJ was paid the highest, the Bulls team salary was more than double the average team payroll those two years.

The only other teams (from 1990-2012) to have such discrepancies from the highest payroll to the average payroll were the Trailblazers in the early 2000s and the Knicks in the mid-2000s.

Moreover, during that time period there were four teams that, at one point, had the highest team payroll and at another point had the lowest. The Bulls were one (with just a three year window separating these two peaks). The other three were the Magic, Blazers and Mavs.",comment

Thanasis get's playing time = guys in the locker room could get upset because Thanasis is taking minutes away from them he doesn't deserve. 

Thanasis develops well and earns minutes = Bucks will have to pay him to keep him. Otherwise, when do they release him? They have to keep him on the team as long as Giannis is there at this point, and I doubt that sits well with other guys in the locker room.

BernardoDeGalvez,et7bahc,t3_ca9k0a,nba,"I don't know if you are interested in overseas fans, but here is my take about it.

I live in Spain. There are a large community of NBA supporters thanks to Pau Gasol first, and then all the other players that went there. 
Here we have a solid basketball fanbase. As you know, we have one of the best nonNBA leagues and teams, and we have a very good national team, so you can say here we have a good basketball fanbase.

Because I love the NBA I am in Telegram groups and I met a lot of people in College who love basketball. And I can say this...

I know about... May be 50-60 people who watch the NBA. 
May be 50% Lakers supporters because of Pau Gasol and Kobe and because our age (we began to follow the NBA with those Shaq Kobe teams)
There are A LOT of people who follow one team. The team LeBron is in. The team Durant is in, Westbrooks team, Hardens team (and now you can sew few Giannis mega fans)
Then I know a few Boston Celtics fans. 
Couple Chicago because of MJ and DRose (yes DRose is looooved here).
One Wizards fan (IDK why)
2 Philly fans (Embiid effect)
1 Knickerboker (Has to be SAS cousin or something).

Here is very normal to see people rooting for Cleveland for LeBron, then Miami, now Lakers... 

But I didn't know about one single person who roots for the Clippers. Neither for Kawhi or PG. Here people say they lack personality.

So... In my Telegram group. People all around Spain and a few from South America, there are not even 1 Clippers supporter. Neither PG or Kawhi supporter.

That's the way it is at least in my experience, nearly 20 years watching NBA and following games consistently since 2006.",comment

There are a lot of us who remember the Clippers playing in the Sports Arena. I remember getting discounted tickets for having a 3.5 GPA or higher (RARE) in my middle school, and no one even got excited whatsoFUCKINGever.

Then the younger ones, who everyone on here wanna call ""nephews"", remember CP3-Blake Griffin and are now ready to cheer for Kawhi/PG and give their undying bandwagoning toward them.

But it's still gotta be 92% Lakers, 8% Clippers off top. We are used to LAKERS parades, Chick Hearn's voice, yelling KOBBBEEEEEE when shooting a fadeaway jumper on the blacktop. 

I get so frustrated because I live in GSW country now and always catch the ""oohhh Lebron dickrider huh?!"" shit from these folks.

NBA_Nephew,et74rn7,t3_ca6q0p,nba,"How will the Timberwolves not even be fun to watch? Im guessing OP didn't watch them last year much. 

KAT is always fun to watch, and this team last year when RoCo was in the line-up had a top-ten defense! 

I get that everyone is making fun of the Wolves because they didn't get DLO, but their other signings have been good, and this is going to be a fun team to watch. They might struggle to get 30-35 wins, but they'll be competitive in almost every game. 

If RoCo and Teague stay healthy, Wiggins plays like he did his 2nd year in the league, and KAT takes a step up, they're making the playoffs. If Culver shows up ready to go, and if Okogie shoots better, this team will be in the 45-50 win range easy. 

Offense hasn't been a problem for this team for over 5 years, it's been defense. Every single guy they've signed this year plays above average defense, I wouldn't even be surprised if KAT drags us to a 5th seed personally. But, could also end up a 25 win team.

&amp;#x200B;

Even Javale looked really tough to stop playing off the ball with Lebron. Just imagine a way younger and smarter and better version in every aspect of the game, but able to play 35 minutes like that instead of barely 20.

&amp;#x200B;

Lebron is still Lebron, Davis is entering his prime, now they have Cousins, but with an entire summer in which he can practice for real, rondo is still there, Danny green, Kuzma.

&amp;#x200B;

It's weird because among the reasons Lebron+Davis and overall the lakers are underrated is that they didn't make the playoffs. Just that, they didn't make it so they must be bad.

Nobody asking himself : but why they didn't make the playoffs and won just 37 games?

&amp;#x200B;

Missed games:

Lebron - 27 games

Ingram - 30 

Kuzma - 12 

Lonzo - 35 

Rondo - 36 

Hart - 15

Their starting 5 played just 18 games together. 18 out of 82 LOL

But since Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are getting the supermax, they will provide a baseline for the type of player we can expect to get paid in the future.  E.G. a player who was top 20 at the time.

BenJoshTobiasAlJoel,et5hjk1,t3_ca2yo6,nba,"The next question, if you will, couldn‚Äôt be any more painfully obvious now: How long will Russell Westbrook remain in Oklahoma City?

Now that the Thunder have chosen to part ways with Paul George, granting his wish by sending him to the Clippers in exchange for a massive haul and helping L.A. land Kawhi Leonard in the process, the uncertainty that surrounds their former MVP is as glaringly obvious as that water tower that breaks up the city‚Äôs skyline in Bricktown. Even before you start to dissect all the personal dynamics, or the history between Westbrook and the organization that has grown so much more complicated in recent years in the wake of Kevin Durant‚Äôs departure, there‚Äôs this harsh reality as it relates to this trade: the timelines between the two sides don‚Äôt match anymore.

When you land the sort of haul that Thunder general manager Sam Presti pulled in, you simply have to come to grips with the fact that the title-contending dream has been replaced by the recovery and rebuild. The Thunder received five first-round picks in all: one unprotected from Miami in 2021 and one protected from the Heat in 2023 (1 to 14); three unprotected from the Clippers in 2022, 2024, and 2026. What‚Äôs more, they received the right to swap picks (unprotected) in 2023 and 2025.

Last but certainly not least, it‚Äôs the arrival of second-year point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander that informs the widespread belief around the league that Westbrook‚Äôs days with the Thunder are numbered. The Clippers spent the entire season raving about the 20-year-old who was taken 11th overall out of Kentucky, envisioning a dream scenario where Kevin Durant and Leonard would come their way and Gilgeous-Alexander would eventually evolve into a worthy co-star alongside those greats.

This, it‚Äôs quite clear, isn‚Äôt the kind of player who would be excited about being a backup for the next four seasons in which Westbrook is owed a combined $171 million (including a player option in 2022-23 in which he‚Äôd be paid $47 million). And if you‚Äôre in Presti‚Äôs position, try chewing on these economics without spitting out your Thunder stick: Gilgeous-Alexander, by comparison, is owed $13.5 million combined during the next three seasons.

So, where does this all go?

Sources confirmed an ESPN report that Presti, Westbrook and his longtime agent, Thad Foucher, are expected to talk in the coming days about how to best handle this unexpected situation. None of them knew until just a few days ago that Leonard had put on his recruiting hat and convinced George to seek a trade, and now they‚Äôre left to figure out the best path forward for all involved. And while the mountains of money owed to Westbrook are known to have scared quite a few general managers away, sources say that Detroit and Miami are very real possibilities as potential landing spots for the 30-year-old, eight-time All-Star.

The Heat landed Jimmy Butler via a sign-and-trade with Philadelphia in free agency, and they could conceivably build a package around the likes of Goran Dragic (one year, $19.2 million remaining) and former Thunder guard Dion Waiters (two years, combined $24.7 million) to pair him with Westbrook. The Pistons‚Äô scenario appears to be potentially trickier, with likely candidates to make the salaries match including big man Andre Drummond (two years, $55.8 million combined, including a player option in 2020-21), former Thunder guard Reggie Jackson (one year, $18 million) and Tony Snell (two years, $23.5 million combined, with a player option in 2020-21).

Rival executives have also pinpointed the Houston Rockets as a likely suitor, which would come as no surprise considering the way general manager Daryl Morey has prioritized the pursuit of stars during his entire career (not to mention the possible reunion between Westbrook and his old Thunder teammate James Harden). The notion of Westbrook sharing the floor with two other ball-dominant guards is unorthodox, to say the least, but Morey has long held the belief that landing as many elite players as possible is the path to championship glory.

Though the Thunder discussed George trades with both the Clippers and Raptors this week, multiple sources said Westbrook was not made available in those talks. With George gone, though, discussions are likely to open up.

The Thunder like to move patiently, and in silence. They managed only half of that in trading George, with negotiations that stayed under wraps but were rushed, as necessitated by his sudden trade request and a limited window in which to work.

There‚Äôs no looming deadline with Westbrook, and OKC is unlikely to enter lightly into trading him. He has played his entire 11-year career with the Thunder. Parting would be painful, even if both parties agree it‚Äôs for the best.

Despite Westbrook‚Äôs steely exterior, he may be more connected to a single fan base ‚Äî and more embraced by it ‚Äî than any superstar in the league. Kevin Durant moved on; George came and went. But Westbrook‚Äôs commitment to the Thunder has never publicly wavered.

Still, his legacy is complicated.

The Thunder haven‚Äôt won a playoff series since Durant left for Golden State in free agency. Oklahoma City tried pairing Westbrook with Victor Oladipo and then with George without postseason success to show for it.

Those playoff struggles might ease the burden of losing Westbrook for a franchise that grew accustomed to success for most of its first decade. If the Thunder under Westbrook have grown stale, is it time to start fresh?

That‚Äôs the next question facing the Thunder, and it may prove challenging to answer. Westbrook is rooted in Oklahoma City‚Äôs past, but their future together rarely has seemed so uncertain.",comment

TrollThatDude,et6dl4z,t3_ca78dv,nba,"I don't get why people think it's  controversial that Butler chose Miami when he insists he is all about winning. The whole point of winning is because it's supposed to be hard and competitive, there is not point in winning when it's plain sailing. 

Him staying in Philly would definitely maximize his chances at a ring but it would be way easier to win a ring in Philly than it is to get to the ECF with Miami for example. That's all he needs to do to be a winner in my eyes. Overachieve.

When Butler says he is all about winning he means he is all about competition and giving it your all to win, putting everything on the table. If you win by coasting, like GSW did last year for example, what is even the point of winning? I'm not saying Philly would coast to a ring, I'm saying that winning doesn't only mean the ring, this ring or bust philosophy is such a load of crap. 

I just don't see how forming a superteam doesn't undercut the value of a ring. Sure, you won, but you had like a way better team around you and not only due to you. Like imagine if LeBron successfully recruited Kawhi to the Lakers, what would his achievement be? That he won a ring with the most loaded team ever? Like yeah good shit sherlock, you managed to do it! You had an Uzi and the other guys came with knives..

I personally commend him for going to a worse team and as a casual fan, I have nothing but respect for the Heat, Pat Riley is a GOAT and they always manage to be competitive even with a shit roster.",comment

Simmons was problematic in his first playoff run and was much better when relegated to the dunkers spot. But as soon as I heard Richardson could be a return in a S&amp;T I was all in. He's a better fit on both ends and can lock up the small guards that killed the Sixers last season.

Good luck to Butler and by extension, Miami. He should be good for at least 3-4 more seasons. He has way more tread on his tires than everyone thinks and his game isn't predicated on athleticism.",comment

The fact that the Heat are trying to trade for every other star is just proof that Jimmy was sold on a plan that ends up on another star joining us, either via trade or in 2021 FA, but sure, keep thinking we'll just tread water for the rest of Jimmy's contract and then act surprised when we make more big moves",comment

ThrowTheBones93,et5l5ak,t3_ca1f4m,nba,"No. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with teaming up with another star... pretty much every championship team in history has had multiple stars, if not hall of famers. Even teaming up with two stars is okay in my mind, depending on their level of stardom. For example, Bosh was a lower tier star, somewhere in the top 12 to 25 players in the league.

I think the Heat super team was toeing the line between acceptable and disgraceful, but after what LeBron had to deal with in Cleveland I don‚Äôt blame him for doing it. Plus, it was more of a counter to Boston‚Äôs Big Three (Four). Had he joined the Celtics, it would‚Äôve been truly pathetic... which is exactly what Durant did.

I also think Kawhi joining the Lakers would‚Äôve been disgraceful, as it would‚Äôve given them three of the top seven players in the league, and arguably THE top three players. Though the fact that he‚Äôs already won two rings and FMVPs would‚Äôve made it less pathetic more of just a head scratcher... like... why are you ring chasing?

Long story short, no I don‚Äôt think Jimmy‚Äôs decision is commendable. In fact, I put him in the Bosh category of stardom, so joining a team with two stars (or in his case, staying in Philly) would‚Äôve been fine.",comment

He wanted to play for a nice location such as Miami. Also, he didn‚Äôt want to be in Embiid and Simmons shadow once they take over this team. Yes, he does want to win, but he wants to be the sole reason his team is winning and people to applaud him and only him for that. Plus, he wants to do it with nice beaches and instathots. The Sixers could put the best situation for him to win but couldn‚Äôt put out HIS situation that he wanted to win in.

Sixers are one bounce away from OT against the team that wins it all, poised to keep most of the roster and run it back, also gets offered the max.  Says F this and signs with Miami.

Right now (pending any more minimum signings) I'd guess Utah's depth chart looks like:

PG: Mike Conley / Dante Exum / Emmanuel Mudiay

SG: Donovan Mitchell / Royce O'Neale / Miye Oni

SF: Bojan Bogdanovic / Joe Ingles

PF: Jeff Green / Georges Niang / Jarrell Brantley

C: Rudy Gobert / Ed Davis / Tony Bradley

With some positively flexibility, especially for Ingles, O'Neale, and Bogdanovic who will likely all play both on the wing and 4. I wouldn't be shocked if one or both of Brantley and Oni are on two-way contracts or if the Jazz bring in one more vet min.",comment
