Apologize for being a day late, I know you all couldn't wait for this.   
  
For a schedule of posts, you can head over to the [Methodology and Hub Post](https://www.reddit.com/blrm1j). You can follow the links to see past weeks lists and follow ups.
 
Each week will follow roughly the same formula, with a couple of random additions week to week based on conversations in the comments of the current week’s list.
 
To lead off each week you’ll have the lists being discussed so you can get caught up:
 
#PART 1 - POLL
 
The below link below features a quick poll for the players ranked #30 thru 21. Please fill out the poll since I’m sure you’re all itching to let us know what you think!
 
##[User Poll - #30-21](https://forms.gle/GS5Lr8rgcT3EPogA8)*

The second piece each week will be a small write up from one of the Top 100 rankers, explaining their methodology for how they determined their own personal Top 100 list. The hope is that not only will these write ups better inform the readers to our processes, but it is also in the hopes that maybe (just maybe) one of the readers sees them and decides to apply next season to join us.) Please note that not every ranker will give you their full process, so please don’t go after them if they don’t explain something to your liking. Pinging then and asking respectful questions will go a lot further in getting you any answers you are missing.)
 
#PART 2 - RANKER’S CORNER
 
This one is from /u/wrhslax1996 [](/PHI). This was his first year as a ranker.  
  
&gt;Greetings. I'm going to provide a brief rundown of how I evaluated players for my top 100 list. This was my first year as a ranker, so the process was new to me. I don't claim that this process is perfect and its something I hope to improve for next season. I am open to any ideas for improving/revamping my strategy.

&gt;First and foremost, I compiled the list of nominated players, divided them up by position, and put them into a spreadsheet. I did not want to factor in positional importance with my list, so my plan was to find various statistics (especially efficiency stats) for each player, find out the average of the nominated players in each of those statistics, and figure out who was the best, statistically, relative to the top players at each position. To provide an example, I'll take a deeper dive into my process for the WRs. Also, I came up with a nominal 13+ games played threshold. I figured playing more than 75% of a season was a reasonable cutoff point to avoid relying too heavily on pure efficiency. 

&gt;The nominated WRs were: Humphries, Thielen, Cooper, MBC, B. Cooks, D. Adams, Nuk, D. Baldwin, J. Landry, Juju, Julio, K. Allen, K. Golladay, L. Fitzgerald, Michael Thomas, Mike Evans, OBJ, R. Woods, S. Diggs, TY Hilton, T. Boyd, T. Lockett, T. Hill. I accumulated the following statistics for each of them: targets, targets/game, receptions, receptions/game, rec. yards, ypg, rec. TDs, yards/route run, yards/rec, 1st downs, 1st downs/game, drops, drops/target, target QB rating, yac, and yac/reception. I figured that spread of statistics would at least give me a somewhat solid overview of how they stacked up against one another both in terms of efficiency and volume. I then took the average of each statistic and compared each player to that average. For example, the average yards/route run in this group for the 2018 season was 2.12. Anyone above that number was shaded green, anyone below was shaded orange. I did that for every statistic in order to see which WRs stacked up best against the other WRs. Any player who had red across most/all of the statistics (meaning they were statistically below average compared to the top 2018 WRs) was a longer shot to make the list. Some of the nominated WRs who were immediately long shots by this process were: Adam Humphries, Amari Cooper, Brandon Cooks (had the bulk yards, but that was pretty much all he came in above average in other than drops), Doug Baldwin, Jarvis Landry, Kenny Golladay, Larry Fitzgerald, Tyler Boyd, Tyler Lockett (perfect target QB rating but was only thrown to 70 times which was the lowest of any WR nominated). That helped put 10/23 nominations on the backburner. Meanwhile, my games played threshold allowed me to do the same with OBJ. With the remaining 12 players, it turned into a stat comparison/film watching (via all-22 and twitter links) to see who really excelled as route runners, who was strong at the point of the catch, who was consistently beating CBs, etc when it came down to ranking the WRs. 

&gt;I did that with every group and finally had positional rankings. From there, it was a lot of eye-test and how above average, relative to their positions, they were in order to determine their placement on my top 100 list. This was definitely the hardest part of the list, but it was also the most fun part, if I'm being honest. There's really no right or wrong way to compare a RB to an OT or a CB to a DT, it's all in the eyes of whoever is ranking the player. 

&gt;In summary, this year my rankings relied pretty heavily on who played the best at their respective positions and who was able to, for lack of a better phrase, separate themselves from the pack the most. It's not perfect, but I felt that, for the most part, my list was pretty decent (though I'm sure you'll find some headscratchers on every list you look at).

# PART 4 - THE SPECIALISTS
 
You all wanted us to rank kickers and punters within the list, according to last year’s polls, but to be totally honest this list has never really been able to quantify the worth of a kicker or punter against other positions because of the lack of meaningful snaps in comparison to other players on the list.
 
For this reason, after rankings had been completed I asked rankers to rank kickers and punters from a list if they wanted to. Those who did ranked 10 out of the top 20 kickers (based on total points in 2018) and 10 out of the top 20 punters (based on gross average per punt). Yes, I am aware that this knocked [insert your K/P here] out of the list and it is an abomination because they [did this totally amazing thing or had this great stat] in 2017. Please understand that this list has no bearing on anything, anywhere, and getting frustrated over it will really just end up giving you heart palpitations in the long run, and no one needs that.
 
***KICKER #3*** - **GREG ZUERLEIN** [](/LAR)
 
| GAMES | FGA | FGM | LONG FG | XPA | XPM | POINTS |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 11 | 31| 27| 56 yds | 36| 35| 116 |
 
Zuerlein is already excited for the next chapter in his career as an NFL head coach given his top qualities - being with McVay. 
 
***PUNTER #3*** - **THOMAS MORSTEAD** [](/NO)
 
| GAMES | PUNTS | YARDS | BLOCKED | LONG |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 16 | 43 | 1996| 0 | 60 yds |
 
Rated well for having the easiest job in the NFL last season. Tough life for this guy.

what_u_want_2_hear,t3_ca8vit,nfl,"&gt; Stringer and the Vikings practiced Tuesday in full gear on the hottest day of the year in the Midwest. The heat index rose to 110 degrees.

[Some details of his death.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korey_Stringer#Death_at_training_camp)

Korey Stringer arrived at the hospital with a body temp of 108. The type of heat that his body and the weather generated, basically cooked his organs and he died when they failed.

Since Stringer's death, a lot has changed. 

Professional teams looked almost immediately at their legal liability. Hard to feel great about that, but it is what gets people's attention. Creating an unsafe work (or school) environment? You are liable, but OSHA really limits just what you are liable for and in what situations. Once the NFL realized they could not completely skirt this liability (like they are trying to do with CTE), they began to make changes. Some quick, but often slowly.

The NFL began to realize the players are the product. If you are a team that is losing star players to death and injury, you won't be competitive. Again, not great to think of people this way, but welcome to sports entertainment. 

It was ridiculous, obscene, and negligent that NFL teams were putting players through the kinds of training camps they historically conducted. Stringer was probably 350 pounds, with his helmet, full gear weighing 30 pounds, and practicing in deadly heat conditions. If you visit camps today, you will see a massive focus on how to best train the players safely. That is directly related to Korey Stringer's death and may be his legacy. 

Globally you had professional sports looking at technology (wearable) and improved training techniques to protect players (assets). The NFL, along with other wealthy leagues, were the customers and funding became available like never before. 


Not everything has changed, though. High Schools and College players still practice at risk in dangerous conditions.

First, many coaches and athletes don't pay enough attention to the humidity. They look mostly at the temp, but even 80 degrees can be deadly with high humidity, sun, and physical activity.

Second, it usually takes the death of someone to force changes. Cobb County in Georgia, after tje death of a high school player, require a device to gauge the combined dry air temperature, humidity, ground-radiated heat and wind speed. The device alerts coaches and staff of dangerous conditions.

Third, the mentality has not changed enough that pushing through training in heat makes you tough. It took decades to get it through coaches heads that water breaks don't make you weak (as they stood around in shorts with huge bellies). Players are still dying at the college and high school levels.

**Vikings Response:** I'm ashamed.

* Team implied Korey used a diet supplement containing ephedrine and that caused his death. Toxicology report revealed no evidence that was true.
* Korey's widow sued, but very powerful NFL lawyers even got immunity for the trainers. 
* Korey died in 2001. Not until 2009 was any settlement reached.

It is common for very powerful people/companies to beat you in court with lawyers so that a precedence cannot be established. This was cruel to do to Korey's widow and family. Ask Randy Moss how he feels about what happened here. There was a settlement (as is usual) that was sealed.

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **New England Patriots.**

Not only did Buoniconti receive Second Team All Pro honors in 1963, but he’s a member of the AFL All-1960s First Team as well.

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The easiest decision in this entire series was putting Tom Brady in the sixth round spot. I don’t even need to explain why this is a good move. Next, it was about slotting the Hall of Famers in there, so John Hannah got the first round spot, and Curtis Martin got the third round spot. I mentioned earlier that a player’s career with other teams does not count; however, Martin is on here because his three years with New England were really good. If Martin put up awful stats with the Patriots, he wouldn’t be on here; however, when you look at the other halfbacks that the Patriots had drafted, the move made sense to use Martin here.

In terms of places where there could really only be one option, Jon Morris in the fourth round was an easy call. Nobody else that the Patriots drafted in the fourth round that played for New England even comes close to Morris and his accolades, and he should be in the Hall of Fame. At this point, the QB was filled, along with the HB and two of the offensive line spots. Time to give Brady some weapons to throw to. For that, I gave him Rob Gronkowski in round two, Ben Coates in round five (special teams does not count, so Slater was never even considered), and Troy Brown in round seven (although you could go with Edelman here; it doesn’t make too much of a difference). Choosing the offense was pretty straightforward.

**Defense:** First, I have to slot in the necessary Hall of Famers. Andre Tippett in round two and Nick Buoniconti in the 7+ spot were the obvious calls, as nobody else really came close to the production from a rounds perspective that they did; this also fills both of the required linebacker spots. Larry Eisenhauer in round six was a cut above everyone else drafted in that spot, and I opted for Asante Samuel over Johnny Rembert (the only other really good round four player) because the secondary needed more help than the linebackers. My hands were also tied when it came to round five, as Fred Marion seemed like the only good option.

With that, there were two rounds to fill, and in the third round, I had to go with Tedy Bruschi, because there were no other quality options. Had Steve McMichael done anything of note with the Patriots, he would’ve slid in there, and I would’ve used the first round spot on either Mike Haynes or Ty Law; however, by taking Bruschi here, it essentially meant I had to put a defensive lineman in the round one spot. There were two really good ones to choose from between Vince Wilfork and Richard Seymour, but in the end, I opted for Seymour; I’m sure this can go either way. Again, the point of this exercise is to craft the best team possible; had I gone with a Hall of Famer in the round one spot by taking either Mike Haynes or Ty Law, the defensive line would’ve suffered big time. It was either a combination of Ty Law and Trey Flowers, or Asante Samuel and Richard Seymour; the drop-off from Law to Samuel is way less than the drop-off from Seymour to Flowers.

**/r/NFL Rates**

How good is this team? That’s where I want you guys to come in so that there’s an interactive element before we do the postseason voting in a month. Based on the roster that you saw, how far do you think this team can go? Will they be a first round exit, or will they make it all the way to the championship?

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18282669)**

Note that for seeding purposes, I’m going to split it up between the AFC and NFC, and will rank the teams 1-16 in each conference based off of their lifetime winning percentage.

Yesterday, I asked how far you thought the Miami Dolphins were going to go. Here were the results:

Round | Percentage
--- | ---
**Round of 32** | **36%**
Sweet 16 | 27%
Elite Eight | 15%
Final Four | 9%
Lose in the Championship | 0%
Win the Championship | 12%

---

**Final Thoughts**

It’s going to be insanely difficult to find a team that is better than this. There isn’t a weak spot on this team. On offense, Tom Brady is leading things, and he’s got two guys on the offensive line who have made it to a combined 16 Pro Bowls. He can hand the ball off to a Hall of Fame halfback, or throw it to a 15-year veteran, a member of an all-decade team, or arguably the greatest tight end of all-time. And on defense, there are two linebackers in the Hall of Fame, along with some studs elsewhere like Richard Seymour and Asante Samuel. Everyone on this team has made it to at least one Pro Bowl. It would be shocking if this team didn’t make it to the Final Four, at minimum. This team is that good. Any time you can avoid using your first round spot on a QB, you’ve got a good shot to put together a great team, and the Patriots are a prime example of that.

We’ll do the 7-on-7 team for the **New York Jets** bright and early tomorrow at 6:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day for the next team’s roster.","/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7-Round Tournament: New England Patriots",post

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

cwoznyi,t3_ca7265,nfl,"I love the NFL playoff format, it's better imo than the NBA &amp; NHL playoffs which allow 8 teams from each conference to compete in the playoffs. However, over the years some solid teams have ended up missing the playoffs so I thought I'd ask the question out of all of the best teams to never make the playoffs which ones do you think could have made a SB run? Given how good that team was and how the actual playoffs that year played out.

If I had to choose I'd have to say:

**2014 Eagles** - I actually forgot that this team didn't make the playoffs in 2014, they were 9-3 after Week 13 (Smashed the Cowboys in Wk13, had two losses by 5 points or less, only blowout loss was against Green Bay who were very good that year.) They lost to Seattle 24-14 in Wk14 in a close one and then unraveled in Wk's 15 &amp; 16 losing to the Cowboys and Redskins in close games, they beat the Giants to round out the season but still missed the playoffs at 10-6. Some of the teams that got in ahead of them? 7-8-1 Panthers and the 11-5 injury stricken Cardinals. Considering how the NFC playoffs played out that year I'm pretty certain they win on Wild Card Weekend and if they arrive with their best game they could easily win their way to the SB and I don't think it'd be impossible for them to compete against the 2014 Pats in SB XLIX.

Or if I went for a more controversial pick, I'd go for the **2013 Cardinals** They started the season 3-4 and iirc their loss against the Rams was the result of a late pick-6. They would go on to lose only 2 games for the rest of the season (24-21 against the Eagles who were good that year and against the 49ers, 20-23 in the final week when they ultimately couldn't make the playoffs anyway due to a tiebreaker.) oh and one of their wins was against the Seahawks away from home. This team was pretty much hot garbage for the first 7 weeks but after that they really started to hit their stride and almost won out and if they had done so would have finished 12-4 and made the playoffs which is quite crazy to think about. With a bit of luck in the playoffs, I think they really could have won out which sounds crazy considering every team in the NFC playoffs that year were crazy good except for the Packers who finished 8-7-1. But confidence is a crazy thing in sports...",What Are Some Of The Best Teams To Never Make The Playoffs That Realistically Could Have Made A SB Run?,post

JaguarGator9,t3_c9uhux,nfl,"I was able to find **[someone’s 1994 thesis paper on the survival of the Packers in Wisconsin](https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1281&amp;context=etd)**, and one of the articles referenced in that was a 1921 article. Keep in mind that this was when the league was known as the AFPA; it wouldn’t even become the NFL until 1922. I’m not sure whether the article was referring to their November 20 game at the Chicago Cardinals, or their November 27 game at the Chicago Staleys; regardless, here’s what the writer had to say, in full (if you're looking through the paper, it's on page 12):

&gt; “Green Bay surely has a bunch of wild football fans. At least 400 of the bugs will follow the Packers, their professional football team, to Chicago… The railroad fare from Green Bay to Chicago and return is $9.69, not including night accommodations, meals, and ticket to the game. **When 400 fans are willing to spent that much money to see a professional team play, we wonder what they would do if they had a team that played real football, say like Lawrence College, in their town.”**

At the time, takes like that were commonplace. The college game was seen as far superior to the NFL game, and in the early days of pro football, teams were folding left and right. One century later, though, and it’s amazing how far the game has come to a point where any take like that made in 2019 would be laughably bad.

I looked up Lawrence College’s average attendance in 2018, and it came out to 819. For the Packers, their average attendance in 2018 was 77,834. Not too bad for a team that doesn’t play real football.","[Article from 1921] “Green Bay surely has a bunch of wild football fans. At least 400 of the bugs will follow the Packers to Chicago. We wonder what they would do if they had a team that played real football, say like Lawrence College, in their town.”",post

RentalCut,t3_ca9jgx,nfl,"In my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c9xo92/oc_new_stat_adjusted_yards_gained_per_touch/) I re-contextualized the quarterback stat Adjusted Yards gained per Attempt (or AY/A) for running backs, creating a new stat that I chose to call Adjusted Yards gained per Touch (or AY/T). The formula is as follows:

AY/T = (Scrimmage Yards + 20 \* Touchdowns - 45 \* Fumbles) / (Touches) 

People seemed to really like the idea, but u/Gutzy34 pointed out that if I were to be including what RBs contributed in the receiving game, I should also be including the targets thrown the RBs' way that fell incomplete and count them as a 0, as opposed to what I did in my original post where I only counted raw receptions. I agreed, and I went to work on adding the incomplete targets to the data I had already collected yesterday. I'm going to call this new stat **Adjusted Yards gained per Opportunity (or AY/O)**, with opportunities being the sum of an RBs rushing attempts and receiving targets.

**AY/O = (Scrimmage Yards + 20 \* Touchdowns - 45 \* Fumbles) / (Opportunities)** 

Even though I posted the spreadsheet that included the entire list of the 224 RB seasons I ran the numbers for in the bottom of my original post, people seemed to really take to the top ~~25~~ 29 list I included in the post, so I'll post the updated version here. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the top 25 AY/O seasons by a RB since 2010 ( ≥ 200 opportunities) out of the 245 qualifying seasons (there were 21 extra seasons that qualified now that I added in incomplete targets):

This was done in an effort to put the Ezekiel Elliots and Adrian Petersons (your old school ground and pounders) of the world on a level playing field with the Alvin Kamaras and the LeSean McCoys (modern pass catching backs). Did I actually succeed in doing that? I'm not so sure. When comparing the AY/T list and the AY/O list, there isn't much of a consistent trend of ""non-pass catching"" backs benefiting from the addition of incomplete targets to the formula. While Zeke's 2016 went up a spot, Marshawn Lynch's 2014 went down five spots. While Derrick Henry's 2018 went up four spots, Jordan Howard's 2016 fell *seventeen spots*. If anything, I felt as if this was ""hurting"" the non-pass catchers more than it was the high-volume pass catchers, as (and this is anecdotal, I don't actually have numbers backing this up) it very much seemed like high-volume pass catching backs (for the most part) typically had a higher catch percentage than non-pass catchers. My overall conclusion regarding this is *RBs who are good receivers are better at catching passes than RBs who aren't good receivers.* 

There were a few people in my OG post who said that AY/T (and by extension AY/O, because while AY/O is a more ""complete"" metric, it's still very similar) benefits pass catching backs too much. After making this post, I've come to the conclusion that... yeah, it does give pass catching backs the upper hand. Why? Because RBs who can catch passes are by and large more efficient per touch/per opportunity than RBs who don't catch passes, and are overall more valuable. Guys like Elliot and Peterson are being """"""slighted"""""" by the metric because they just aren't as efficient as they could be. I think that the league as a whole is starting to come to this conclusion too... as five of top ten most efficient RB seasons of the decade (according to AY/O) literally just happened less than twelve months ago.

Okay I really need to hit the gym now. **Here's a link to a spreadsheet to the full list of all the qualifying seasons in both AY/T and AY/O from 2010-2018:** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zv2UGX9OETXGzUKvKhM6UEs1baocW1tst9y\_pSx8Go/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zv2UGX9OETXGzUKvKhM6UEs1baocW1tst9y_pSx8Go/edit?usp=sharing)",[OC] Adjusted Yards gained per Touch 2: Electric Boogaloo,post

xX_Danktacion,t3_ca0ghl,nfl,"The 2017 season for the L.A. Rams and the 2018 season for Chicago Bears were both notable campaigns, as both teams ended a long playoff drought by reaching the post-season. However, there are some things that are similar with those teams… Did I cherry pick some specifics facts to fit a narrative? Yeah, probably, but it’s the offseason, so who cares.

* Both teams use a 3-4 type of defense.
* Both teams had 7 more wins than their previous season :

1. Rams record in 2016 : 4-12. Rams record in 11-5
2. Bears record in 2017 : 5-11. Bears record in 2018 : 12-4

* The starting QB for both teams was the highest selected Quarterback in the previous year’s draft. (Jared Goff at 1st           in 2016 and Mitchell Trubisky at 2nd in 2017)
* Both teams were the 3rd seed for the playoffs and lost in the Wild Card round against the defending NFC Champions. (The Rams lost to the Falcons in 2017, and the Bears lost to the Eagles in 2018)
* Both teams had 8 players selected to the Pro Bowl :

|Todd Gurley|Eddie Jackson|
|Aaron Donald|Kyle Fuller|
|Jared Goff|Akiem Hicks|
|Greg Zuerlain|Tarik Cohen|
|Jake McQuaide|Cody WHitehair|
|Andre Withworth|Khalil Mack|
|Johhny Hecker|Mitchell Trubisky|
|Pharoh Cooper|Charles Leno Jr.|

&amp;#x200B;

* Both Head coaches won the “Head Coach of the Year” award as rookie Head coaches. (Sean McVay in 2017 and Matt Nagy in 2018)
* Finally, the 2018 Rams had no 1st round and 2nd round draft pick, and the 2019 Bears also do not have a 1st round and 2nd round draft pick. (This isn’t related to the 2017 Rams and 2018 Bears, but I think it’s relevant to say it.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the end, does this mean that the 2019 Bears will reach the Superbowl just like the 2018 Rams? Who knows?

In the case of Mark Barron for sure, and maybe Devin Hester as well, depending on how the falcons used him (did he play receiver at all?) Even after a trade to another team they were allowed to keep their non-conforming number and stay in a different position

ThatPackerFan,t3_ca8kwm,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 41: 1960 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 23-December 18, 1960

Teams: 13 (up from 12 the previous year)

1960 NFL Draft: 240 selections (20 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1960 First Draft Pick: Billy Cannon, Runningback from Louisiana State University (Los Angeles Rams)

1960 AP Most Valuable Player: Norm Van Brocklin, Quarterback (Philadelphia Eagles)

1960 NFL Championship Game: Philadelphia Eagles (10-2-0) defeated Green Bay Packers (8-4-0) 17-13 at Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.

The 1960 season of the NFL featured a lot of changes. First, Pete Rozelle became the new commissioner after 23 ballots. The Dallas Cowboys entered the league, the Cardinals relocated from Chicago to St. Louis, and the American Football League would debut with 8 teams all of which would carry lineage into the NFL with the merger, and still exist today. Those 8 teams were: Buffalo Bills, Houston Oilers (Tennessee Titans), New York Titans (New York Jets), Boston Patriots (New England Patriots), Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos, Dallas Texans (Kansas City Chiefs), and Oakland Raiders. In the AFL's [inaugural season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/ca8kxx/nfl100_100_days_100_years_afl_day_1/), the Oilers beat the Chargers 24-16 in the championship game.

Philadelphia lost its opener at home to Cleveland, 41–24, then went on a 9-game winning streak. The breakthrough came in Week 6 on October 30, when unbeaten New York (3–0–1), 2-time defending conference champions, came off their bye and lost at home to St. Louis, 20–13, while the Browns and idle Eagles were both at 4–1. In Week 7, New York beat Cleveland, 17–13, and the Eagles beat Pittsburgh 34–7. The Eagles clinched the Eastern Conference after ten games at 9–1; they dropped a game the next week in the snow at Pittsburgh, and finished the regular season at 10–2, 1½ games ahead of Cleveland. 2 of the wins in the streak were in consecutive games (November 20 and 27) against New York. In the latter game, the Eagles trailed 17–0, then 23–17, before Norm Van Brocklin threw 2 touchdown passes in the final quarter for a 31–23 victory. In the former, the Giants' Frank Gifford was severely injured in a tackle by linebacker Chuck Bednarik late in the game that almost ended his career. New York entered that November 20 game at 5–1–1, but won only once in the last 5 games, including a tie to Dallas, the Cowboys' sole non-loss of the year, and finished third in the Eastern at 6–4–2. The Giants won the next 3 conference championships for 5 in 6 seasons, but not the league title.

The Western Conference race was one in which Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, and San Francisco all had a lead at one time. The Bears fell back after a Week 6 loss to the 49ers, 25–7. In Week 7, the 4–2 Colts and the 4–1 Packers met on November 6 in Green Bay. 2-time defending NFL champion Baltimore, which had lost an earlier match, won 38–24, to take the lead in the Western. In Week 10, the Colts (6–2) came off their bye and lost at home to San Francisco, 30–22, to begin a streak of 4 defeats. Baltimore's 20–15 loss to the Lions, and Green Bay's 41–13 win at Chicago, tied the Colts and Packers at 6–4 in Week 11. After the Packers' 13–0 win at San Francisco, their record was 7–4, while the Colts, Lions and 49ers were all at 6–5. San Francisco and Detroit both won the next week, the former beating Baltimore 34–10, but the Packers won the day before, downing Los Angeles 35–21 for the Western title, their first in 16 years.

The new Dallas Cowboys lost their first ten games but managed a 31–31 tie against the Giants at Yankee Stadium in New York on December 4. They finished at 0–11–1, a winning percentage of .000, rather than .042. Under the rules at the time, ties were ignored in computing winning percentage, which was changed prior to the 1972 season.

The 1960 NFL Championship Game was played between the Eagles and Packers in front of 67,325 fans in Philadelphia, PA. The Packers were road favorites by 2-3 points. This was also the first NFL Championship Game coached by Vince Lombardi. The game featured quarterbacks Norm Van Brocklin for the Eagles and Bart Starr for the Packers.

On the first play from scrimmage, a lateral from Van Brocklin deflected off the hands of receiver Billy Ray Barnes and was intercepted by Bill Quinlan of the Packers, giving Green Bay possession at the Philadelphia 14-yard line. After Jim Taylor gained 5 yards on first down, the Packers were unable to score, turning the ball over to Philadelphia at the 6-yard line. A fumble on the Eagles' third play after gaining possession by Bill Barnes was recovered by Bill Forester of Green Bay at the 22-yard line of Philadelphia. 2 Paul Hornung rushes gave the Packers a first down at the 12-yard line, but 2 incomplete passes and another Hornung rush came up short. Lombardi elected to kick on fourth down, with Hornung connecting from 20 yards out and giving the Packers a 3–0 lead.

Hornung kicked a second field goal in the opening minutes of the second quarter from 23 yards out, after a Packers drive stalled on the 17-yard line, putting Green Bay up 6-0. On a pair of passes from Van Brocklin to Tommy McDonald of 22 yards and 35 yards respectively, the Eagles scored a touchdown and the extra point by kicker Bobby Walston gave them their first lead of the game. After getting the ball back from Green Bay, Van Brocklin connected on a pass of 41 yards to Pete Retzlaff that was followed 3 plays later by a 22-yard pass play to Ted Dean that put the Eagles on the Packers' 8-yard line. After 3 incomplete passes, a field goal gave the Eagles a 10–6 lead. On the following drive in the waning minutes of the first half, Green Bay took the ball to the Philadelphia 7-yard line. The threat fizzled after Bart Starr was sacked for a loss and the field goal attempt by Paul Hornung was wide left from 12 yards out.

A drive by the Packers in the third quarter advanced to the Philadelphia 34-yard line, but Green Bay failed to convert on fourth down, turning the ball over to the Eagles and losing Hornung to a shoulder injury. The Eagles promptly marched down deep into Green Bay territory but a Van Brocklin pass was intercepted in the end zone by John Symank. The touchback gave the Packers the ball on their own 20-yard line. In punt formation on fourth down, Max McGee ran for 35 yards to give Green Bay a first down in Philadelphia territory. Despite the successful run on the fake punt, Lombardi was not pleased, saying ""We punt the ball; we don't run the ball"" when the team sets up for a punt.

In the final quarter, continuing that same drive, the Packers advanced deep into Philadelphia territory on runs by backs Tom Moore and Jim Taylor and retook the lead with a 7-yard pass from Bart Starr to McGee with 13:07 left in the game. Hornung came off the bench to kick the extra point, giving Green Bay a 13–10 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Ted Dean received the ball on his own 3-yard line and returned the ball 58 yards, giving Philadelphia excellent field position at the Green Bay 39-yard line. Dean provided what turned out to be the margin of victory for the Eagles with a 5-yard touchdown run on a sweep led by a key block from guard Gerry Huth with 5:21 left in the fourth quarter, capping off a drive in which Van Brocklin passed the ball only one time. Green Bay got the ball for the last time on their 35-yard line with 1:05 left, and drove deep into Philadelphia territory. At the Philadelphia 22 with seconds to play and no time-outs left, Starr threw a short pass to Taylor; Chuck Bednarik, the last Eagle between Taylor and the end zone, tackled him at the Eagles' 10-yard line and remained atop Taylor as the final seconds ticked off the clock, ensuring that Taylor could not get up off the ground and that the Packers could not run another play. Bednarik had played both defense and offense, and was in for every play of the game; he growled ""You can get up now, Taylor. This damn game's over.""

The 1960 title game proved to be a key event in the history of the league. It would be the only career playoff loss for Packer head coach Lombardi (9–1), and would be the last Eagles championship until Super Bowl LII 57 seasons later. Lombardi would later rue his decision to go on fourth down on several occasions deep in Philadelphia territory rather than attempt field goals on such plays, saying ""When you get down there, come out with something. I lost the game, not my players.""

ThatPackerFan,t3_ca8kxx,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game, including that of the American Football League, which debuted in 1960 during the NFL's 41st season.

Season 1: 1960 AFL (American Football League)

Duration: September 9-December 18, 1960

Teams: 8

1960 AP AFL Player of the Year: Abner Haynes, Runningback (Dallas Texans)

1960 AFL Championship Game: Houston Oilers (10-4-0) defeated Los Angeles Chargers (10-4-0) 24-16 at Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, TX.

During the 1950s, the National Football League had grown to rival Major League Baseball as one of the most popular professional sports in the United States. One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the Chicago Cardinals — owned by the Bidwill family — who had become overshadowed by the more popular and more successful Chicago Bears. The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to St. Louis, but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee. Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was Lamar Hunt, son and heir of millionaire oilman H. L. Hunt. Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to Dallas, where he had grown up. However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a previous NFL franchise had failed in 1952. While Hunt negotiated with the Bidwills, similar offers were made by Bud Adams, Bob Howsam, and Max Winter.

When Hunt, Adams, and Howsam were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner Bert Bell and proposed the addition of expansion teams. Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer. On his return flight to Dallas, Hunt conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals. In addition to Adams, Howsam, and Winter, Hunt reached out to Bill Boyer, Winter's business partner, to gauge their interest in starting a new league. Hunt's first meeting with Adams was held in March 1959. Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced Adams to join and found his team in Houston. Hunt next secured an agreement from Howsam to bring a team to Denver.

After Winter and Boyer agreed to start a team in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the new league had its first four teams. Hunt then approached Willard Rhodes, who hoped to bring pro football to Seattle. However, not wanting to undermine its own brand, the University of Washington was unwilling to let the fledgling league use Husky Stadium, and Rhodes' effort came to nothing. Hunt also sought franchises in Los Angeles, Buffalo and New York City. During the summer of 1959, he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry. Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation, Hunt received commitments from Barron Hilton and Harry Wismer to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively. His initial efforts for Buffalo, however, were rebuffed, when Hunt's first choice of owner, Pat McGroder, declined to take part; McGroder had hoped that the threat of the AFL would be enough to prompt the NFL to expand to Buffalo.

On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in Chicago, and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul. On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League at a meeting in Dallas. The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier All-America Football Conference (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league. AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones. Only the party from Minneapolis-Saint Paul accepted, and with the addition of Ole Hausgrud and Bernie Ridder, the Minnesota group joined the NFL in 1961 as the Minnosta Vikings. The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring new NFL teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961. (The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team – the Dallas Cowboys  – actually started play in 1960, and the Vikings began play in 1961.) Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.

Ralph Wilson, who owned a minority interest in the NFL's Detroit Lions at the time, initially announced he was placing a team in Miami, but like the Seattle situation, was also rebuffed by local ownership; given five other choices, Wilson negotiated with McGroder and brought the team that would become the Bills to Buffalo. Buffalo was officially awarded its franchise on October 28. During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from Boston (led by Billy Sullivan) was awarded the AFL's eighth team. On November 30, 1959, Joe Foss, a World War II Marine fighter ace and former governor of South Dakota, was named the AFL's first commissioner. Foss commissioned a friend of Harry Wismer's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo. Hunt was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960. The first AFL draft took place prior to the NFL's 1960 draft, thus leaving a smaller field for the NFL to draft.

The AFL had 8 teams, grouped into 2 divisions. Each team would play a home-and-away game against the other 7 teams in the league for a total of 14 games, and the best team in the Eastern Division would play against the best in the Western Division in a championship game. If there was a tie in the standings, a playoff would be held to determine the division winner.

The Denver Broncos, who would not have a winning season until they went 7–5–2 in 1973, were the Western Division leaders halfway through 1960. They won the AFL's first game, played on Friday night, September 9, 1960, beating the Boston Patriots 13–10. The Patriots' Gino Cappelletti scored the AFL's first points with a 35-yard field goal. Other results in Week 1 were the Los Angeles Chargers 21–20 win over the Dallas Texans, the Houston Oilers 37–22 win over the Oakland Raiders, and the Titans of New York 27–3 win over the Buffalo Bills. In the Raiders game, J.D. Smith caught a pass from Tom Flores to score the first two-point conversion in pro football history.

In Week 8 (October 30), Denver lost to the visiting Texans, 17–14, and did not win any of their last 8 games, finishing with the AFL's worst record at 4–9–1. The Chargers, still in Los Angeles, pulled ahead the next week with a Friday night win over the Titans of New York, 21–7, and finished at 10–4–0. The Eastern Division lead was held by Houston, except for a setback from a 14–13 loss to Oakland on September 25. In Week 5, the Oilers beat the visiting Titans, 27–21 and led the rest of the way.

The 1960 AFL Championship game featured the Oilers and the Chargers playing in front of 32,183 at Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, TX. The game took place on New Year's Day in 1961. The game was broadcast on television by ABC. The Oilers entered the game as 6.5 point favorites.

The Chargers led 6–0 in the first quarter on two field goals by Ben Agajanian, 1 of only 2 players (Hardy Brown) who played in the AAFC, the NFL and the AFL. In the second period, Houston scored on a 17-yard George Blanda pass to All-AFL fullback Dave Smith, then answered a 27-yard Agajanian field goal with a 17-yard kick by Blanda.

In the final quarter, Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon caught a short toss from Blanda and went for an 88-yard touchdown scamper. The Chargers, down by 8 points, tried to reach the end zone on their final possession. Had they scored they could have gone for the two-point conversion, but the clock ran out with the Chargers at the Oilers' 22-yard line.

The American Football League would prove to be the NFL's toughest adversary, and it led to a battle throughout the 1960s which ultimately led to the merger in 1970 between the leagues.

I had a nice idea: At what point in each game was the game *over?* 

What I mean is, at what point could the winning team have just stopped scoring, and they still would have won? 

So, here it is: [a graph.](https://imgur.com/HA5pLGq) 

In the 2018 season, the 3 most common times the Kill Shot is delivered are at the very end of the game (which is what we all expected), at the two-minute warning in the 2nd half, and at the end of the 1st half. The vertical line is the median Kill Shot time, which is midway through the 3rd quarter.

The earliest Kill Shot this year was delivered by the Chiefs when Tyreek Hill scored a 67-yard touchdown against the Raiders with 12:41 remaining in the first half. The Chiefs went on to win that game, 35-3.

Thanks for reading, have a good weekend, everyone!

11bjs,t3_ca92ci,nfl,"I’m particularly exited for this upcoming season, more excited than I’ve ever been in years past. Maybe it’s because it’s the 100th season, maybe it’s because the AAF got taken from me and I’ve been starved of real football since, maybe it’s because I’m a Ravens fan we have a lot of new pieces on our roster. After some thought, I realized why I was so excited for the new year to start. There are so many new young quarterbacks in the league now. It seems like every division has 1 or 2 starting QBs who are still either on their rookie contracts or just recently signed an extension. Not only does it seem like there are more young QBs than usual, it seems like they are all here to play for a long time. In the years before, it seemed like for every Cam Newton and Russell Wilson, there was a whole lot of EJ Manuels and Jake Lockers. What I mean by this is that it seemed like there were a lot of quarterbacks who’d only stick around for a couple years, maybe even only a couple games, and then fizzle out of the league never to be heard or seen again. I decided to see if this was actually true; were more QBs out of the league faster than in years past?




[The average NFL career for a quarterback is three years.](https://work.chron.com/long-average-career-nfl-player-12643.html) By that logic, a quarterback is “significant” if he can last four or more years in the league while also seeing some playing time. That was the first part of my research. I looked up every quarterback draft class from 2002-2015. I then figured out what percentage of those players from each class started their first season and their fourth season. (Example: If a class from 2001 has 15 drafted players and 3 of them start their first year, they have 20%. If in 2004 5 of the 15 are starting, they have 33.3%) If a player started at least 8 games in a season, he was considered a starter. I also included the percent change from the two years as well as a graph. 

*Percent change is how much the totals change from the first to fourth year. If in the first year the percent is 20% and the fourth year it’s 33.3%, the percent change is 66.5% (new total-old total / old total). It is possible for the percent change to be negative. If the percent is 20% the first year but than it is 6.7% the fourth year, the percent change is -66.5%.*

The next part was to see how much that class was starting compared to the rest of the league. There are 256 games in a season, so if a class in total had 3 players start 16 games (48 games total), I divided 48 by 256 which means the class did 18.8% of all the starts in the league that season. This calculation includes non-starters; if the player only started 1 game that season, he was still added to the total count. This also includes the percent change and a graph.

The last page of the document shows the change year-by-year in the two categories. *If you don’t want to see any specific year and just want to see the final results, go straight to this page.* So without further ado, [here it is](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13VrpnIpreA51c1nZ70M73ClKxyBjLhZyGFFKk5IwSos).

As you can see, the early 2000s had many classes that made huge jumps from their first to fourth years, most notably the 2004 and 2005 classes. After the 2006 season however, the numbers drastically declined, but they were sometimes still in the positive percentiles. Since 2010, neither stats make it above zero. What this means is that since 2010-2015, more quarterbacks were out of the league in three years than those who stayed in the league.

So I was right. For 6 years at least, quarterbacks careers have been shorter than usual. This doesn’t mean that all these draft classes are bad, however. Like I said, for every Cam Newton and Russell Wilson, there are EJ Manuels and Jake Lockers. It’s just a lot more Manuels and Lockers going around the league than in the years prior. I don’t know why this happened. I don’t know how or why in the 2000s quarterbacks more quarterbacks started in their fourth year compared to their rookie campaign, but in the 2010s it’s the opposite. Maybe teams became quicker to abandon their QB after one or two inconsistent years. Maybe better and better prospects come out of college and teams want a young flashy quarterback who doesn’t pan out the way they hope and the cycle continues. I don’t know. But I do know this...

Obviously we don’t know what’s going to happen with the next generation of quarterbacks, but we can predict, and the future looks bright. Jared Goff and Carson Wentz are All-Pro level quarterbacks. Dak Prescott is pretty good too. All of the 15 quarterbacks selected in the 2016 draft are still in the league except for the last one picked. The first three quarterbacks in the 2017 draft made the playoffs and are all starters for the foreseeable future. All five of the first round quarterbacks in last year’s draft are now starters. This year’s draft featured some of the best college prospects ever. This generation of quarterbacks are the best it’s been this decade, and they make the hype for the NFL’s 100th season bigger than it’s been for me in a long time.",QB Draft Classes and Their Significance,post

RentalCut,t3_c9xo92,nfl,"So I was messing around on Pro Football Reference earlier this morning looking at QB stats. AY/A (Adjusted Yards gained per pass attempt) is a QB stat that calculates a QB's yards per attempt, but also weights the touchdowns and interceptions that said QB throws in a game/season/career/whatever.

The formula is as follows: *(Passing Yards + 20 \* Passing TD - 45 \* Interceptions) / (Passes Attempted)*

I then went to see if there was a stat like this for RBs/WRs/TEs and there wasn't. There's a raw Yards/Touch stat but nothing more expansive than that, so I decided to """"""make my own"""""". I did some thinking to decide how to approach this and I decided to (as of now) just look at running backs. The formula I used is the exact same as the already established AY/A stat, but with passing yards subbed for scrimmage yards, interceptions subbed for fumbles, and pass attempts subbed for touches. The full formula is as follows:

**AY/T** = **(Scrimmage Yards + 20 \* Touchdowns - 45 \* Fumbles) / (Touches)**

One thing I was unsure of was whether or not I should keep the weighting the same for fumbles, as the opposing defense only recovers a fumble about 50% of the time, where as a QB throwing an INT is a guaranteed turnover (unless Robert Meachum has anything to say about it)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHS0oFXXC8], but I decided to keep it the same though for simplicity's sake, as well as to put extra emphasis on ball security.

Then I got carried away and stat-ed out every &gt;200 touch RB season from 2010-present (224 in total) in order to find whose had the most efficient season of the decade according to this metric. I'll link the entire google spreadsheet at the bottom of the post, but I'll post some of it here to fill out the post a bit

Okay I may have upped it 29 just to fit in the only 4 6.00&lt; seasons that would've been left off.

But as you can see, 2017 Alvin Kamara is far and away the most efficient RB season of this decade (according to this metric). It's also worth noting that LeSean McCoy has *four* seasons in the top 26 (three on the Eagles and one on the Bills), a good indicator he'll probably end up being first team all decade.

I also want to comment of half of the top 16 AY/T performances by a RB happened in 2018. I credit this to teams putting an ever-increasing emphasis on RBs having to catch passes out of the backfield. Pretty much every RB in this top 29 is at the very least an above average pass catching back, and the only one who isn't by my estimation, Adrian Peterson, got here because he put up one of the greatest rushing seasons of all time.

Also, just for fun, the bottom 10 AY/T seasons by a RB since 2010 (&lt;200 touches). Shoutout to my AFC North bros:

ThatPackerFan,t3_ca1rcw,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 40: 1959 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 26-December 13, 1959

Teams: 12

1959 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1959 First Draft Pick: Randy Duncan, Quarterback from the University of Iowa (Green Bay Packers)

1959 AP Most Valuable Player: Johnny Unitas, Quarterback (Baltimore Colts)

1959 NFL Championship Game: Baltimore Colts (9-3-0) defeated New York Giants (10-2-0) 31-16 at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, MD.

The 1959 season was the 40th season in the NFL's history. With it, a few major occurrences that impacted the history of the league and still stand to this day as defining moments in the 100 year history of the league. First, Vince Lombardi became the head coach of the Green Bay Packers, who a year earlier had a league worst 1-10-1 record. The season also featured the death of Bert Bell, the NFL commissioner, who had attended a game between the Eagles and Steelers, and had a heart attack in the stands. His death sparked a series of events that would ultimately lead to the merger between the NFL and the AFL (which didn't debut until 1960).

After the second week, when the 1–1–0 Giants had to share the Eastern Conference lead with all 5 of the other clubs in their conference, the Giants won 7 of the next 8 games to clinch the title in Week 10. In the Western Conference, the San Francisco 49ers, who had come close (1952, 1953, 1954, and 1957) several times since joining the NFL, were 6–1 and had a 2-game lead over their closest rival, the 4–3 Colts. In Week 9, though, the 49ers lost in Baltimore, 45–14 (November 22) and they shared the lead at 6–3–0. Two weeks later, San Francisco had the home field advantage when they faced the Colts for a rematch. Baltimore won again, 34–14, and clinched the conference title the following week.

The 1959 NFL Championship Game was a rematch from the previous season, featuring the Colts and the Giants. The Colts were the home team, and favored to win by 3.5 points. 57,545 attended the only championship game ever played in Baltimore. NBC held the television and radio rights to air the game nationwide.

The scoring began in the opening quarter as Colts Quarterback and MVP Johnny Unitas found Lenny Moore for a 60-yard touchdown pass to put the Colts up 7-0. The remainder of the first half saw Pat Summerall kick 2 Field Goals, of 23 and 37 yards, to put the Giants on the board and make the halftime score 7-6. During the 3rd quarter, Summerall booted a 22-yard field goal through the uprights to give the Giants a 9-7 lead heading into the 4th quarter.

Despite the defensive play through the first 3 quarters, the Colts finally broke through and buried the Giants in the 4th quarter, putting up 24 points. A 4-yard touchdown run from Unitas, a 12-yard pass from Unitas to Jerry Richardson (future owner of the Carolina Panthers), a Johnny Sample 42-yard interception return for a touchdown, and a Steve Myhra 25-yard field goal making it 31-9. The Giants would respond with a Charlie Conerly 32-yard touchdown pass to Bob Schnelker, making it 31-16, but it was far too late as the Colts claimed their 2nd straight title.

This closed out the 1950s decade of NFL football that saw dominance by teams such as the Browns, Lions, Rams and Colts. The 1960s however, would define an era of football that no team has replicated since.

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Miami Dolphins.**

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The only two worthwhile quarterbacks that the Dolphins have drafted that ever played for them are Dan Marino and Bob Griese. Both of them were first round picks, so I had to burn the first round spot on a QB; however, burning it on Marino, one of the best to ever play the position, is by no means a bad thing. Next, I looked at the Hall of Famers after the first round; Dwight Stephenson is the only one, and he was a round two pick, so he slots in there nicely. Then, it was about picking players that were head and shoulders above everyone else in their round; Ed Newman, an offensive lineman in the sixth round, fit that bill nicely, as did Mark Clayton, a wide receiver for the 7+ spot. By this point, the quarterback was filled, a wide receiver spot was filled, and two offensive linemen were filled.

Three spots to go, and I had a dilemma. Initially, I was leaning toward using Mercury Morris in the round three spot, Jim Kiick in the round five spot, and Jeff Dellenbach in the round four spot. However, by doing this, I would have just one receiver; this wouldn’t be a problem if I had a tight end, but I found no good tight end to slide in besides maybe Randy McMichael in the round four spot over Dellenbach. So, I opted to run two receivers, three offensive linemen, and Kiick at halfback; this meant that Nat Moore was in the round three spot, with Mercury Morris on the outside looking in.

**Defense:** First, I have to get the Hall of Famers in; in this case, the Dolphins only had one, and that’s Jason Taylor in the round three spot, so that worked out nicely. As someone who believes that Zach Thomas should absolutely be in the Hall of Fame, I had to give him the round five spot as well. From this point on, though, the combinations got a bit tricky, as each spot had a few options.

For the second round spot, I could’ve picked defensive lineman Bob Baumhower over Sam Madison; however, this would leave the secondary really exposed, as Curtis Johnson would be the top guy instead of Sam Madison. The defensive line is in a very good spot with a Hall of Famer in Jason Taylor and a former Defensive Player of the Year winner in Doug Betters; I figured that the secondary needed more help here. That same logic was why I went with Curtis Johnson in round four over defensive lineman Paul Soliai.

As for AJ Duhe in the first round spot, there were no other linebackers outside of Zach Thomas that made sense for this team. Bryan Cox was great, but he couldn’t be used, because he was a fifth round pick, much like Thomas. John Offerdahl was great, but if I used him, the first round defensive back would have to be Troy Vincent, who did next to nothing with the Dolphins (if I was using Vincent’s entire career, then a Vincent/Offerdahl combination would definitely be the play, but because I’m only looking at what they did with their team, and seeing as Vincent did not make his claim to fame on the field until he went to the Eagles, I opted against it).

**/r/NFL Rates**

How good is this team? That’s where I want you guys to come in so that there’s an interactive element before we do the postseason voting in a month. Based on the roster that you saw, how far do you think this team can go? Will they be a first round exit, or will they make it all the way to the championship?

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18277980)**

Note that for seeding purposes, I’m going to split it up between the AFC and NFC, and will rank the teams 1-16 in each conference based off of their lifetime winning percentage.

Yesterday, I asked how far you thought the Bills were going to go. Here were the results:

Round | Percentage
--- | ---
Round of 32 | 19%
**Sweet 16** | **28%**
Elite Eight | 17%
Final Four | 2%
Lose in the Championship | 21%
Win the Championship | 12%

---

**Final Thoughts**

This team seems very well balanced, and could win some games in the tournament when the time comes. Having a guy like Dan Marino running the show definitely helps, and there isn’t a player on this team that is outright bad; every player on this team is, at worst, good. When you have a defense where all but one player made it to the Pro Bowl, and where the seven players have combined for 24 Pro Bowl appearances, that’s a good sign. And Marino has his top target to throw to, along with his top offensive lineman, and actually has a halfback to hand the ball off to on this team. There’s a lot to like about the makeup of this team.

We’ll do the 7-on-7 team for the **New England Patriots** tomorrow at 10:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day at 12:00 ET for the next team’s roster.","/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7-Round Tournament: Miami Dolphins",post

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

He had 21 sacks in 12 games in 1987. The season was shortened to 15 games due to lockout/strike. It is crazy because Strahan's record is at 22.5. White would have probably got to 25 if it was a full season or if he played 3 more games.

IDontRegreddit,t3_c9mg5z,nfl,"They drafted multiple QBs just outside of the top 20, including Brady Quinn, Brandon Weeden, and Johnny Manziel (all Round 1, pick 22). Some later round QBs were taken as well, such as Colt McCoy and Cody Kessler (3rd round).

The interesting thing about it was just how few QBs they've actually drafted high in the past 20 years, much less how few they drafted at the top of the first round. In hindsight, it seems obvious they never had good QB play - finding starting QBs out of the top half of round 1 is statistically unlikely, despite the Russell Wilsons and Tom Bradys and Drew Brees of the world. They are the exception, not the norm. Even still, you'd think just by the law of averages that they'd have stumbled into a starting qb before now, though, just from so many regime changes and high draft picks. It's unprecedented that they never lucked into someone halfway competent before Baker. It's almost as if they should've been known as a franchise that refused to take a top QB prospect as opposed to a franchise that ruined them.","Strange but true: Since the Browns returned to the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1999, they have only drafted two quarterbacks in the top 20 of the first round: Tim Couch (1999, Round 1, Pick 1) and Baker Mayfield (2018, Round 1, Pick 1)",post

KingMeruem12,t3_c9lo6s,nfl,"The Patriots dynasty has consisted of 9 Super Bowls so far, holding a 6-3 record in those games. I wanted to look at how their offense performed in those games.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be looking at 4th quarter/OT drives for this analysis. A drive that started in the 3rd quarter yet ended in the 4th quarter qualifies as a 4th quarter/OT drive. A drive that ended as a result of kneeling at the end of the 4th quarter does not count as a drive. The Patriots had 29 scoring drive opportunities in the 4th quarter of these nine games.

|*Statistic*|*Count*|
|:-|:-|
|**4th Quarter/OT Drives**|29|
|**Scores**|16|
|**Total TD**|11|
|**FG**|5|
|**Passing TD**|6|
|**INT**|2|
|**Fumbles**|1|
|**Score %**|55.2%|
|**Points/Drive**|3.17|
|**Turnover %**|10.3%|

&amp;#x200B;

The two numbers I want to focus on are the Score % (55.2%) and the Points/Drive (3.17). For reference, here are those numbers of a few of the great offenses of the past 15 years:

&amp;#x200B;

||*Score %*|*Points/Drive*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**2013 Broncos**|47.5%|2.98|
|**2007 Patriots**|52.7%|3.37|
|**2018 Chiefs**|48.3%|3.25|
|**2011 Packers**|52.6%|3.05|

The Score %, the Patriots in the 4th Quarter/OT of the Super Bowl is better than any of the legendary offenses. By points/drive, they sit just in between the 2011 Packers and 2018 Chiefs.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing to mention. The Patriots scored on 16/29 drives. Three of the drives that didn't materialize in a score were last ditch efforts with minimal time remaining:

* 0:35 left in Super Bowl 42 down 3 (needed a FG to stay alive).
* 0:57 left in Super Bowl 46 down 4 (needed a TD to stay alive)
* 1:05 left in Super Bowl 52 down 8 (needed a TD and 2 PT conversion to stay alive)",A closer look at the 4th Quarter/OT Patriots offense in the BB-Brady Super Bowls,post

JaguarGator9,t3_c9gby6,nfl,"Source from [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1060947/2019/07/03/this-week-in-bengals-the-reason-for-john-ross-number-change/). Relevant part listed below since article is behind a paywall:

&gt; Upon being drafted by the Bengals No. 11 was on his mind but already taken by Brandon LaFell. Ross ended up with No. 15.

&gt; There’s not much worth remembering from the two-year run of that number.

&gt; With a new coaching staff comes new hope for Ross. They view him as having untapped potential and capable of much bigger things than just a red-zone weapon with threatening speed.

&gt; Ross made clear this change is about much more than just liking the way a number looks.

&gt; “I felt like, this is my third year, I get a chance to re-invent myself and re-create some of the old me,” Ross said. “I kind of wanted to basically start everything over. I get to put Ross III on the back of my jersey and get to change the number. Hopefully, just change the whole year.”

&gt; How much does Ross want to re-invent himself? Well, this process isn’t as easy as one would think. In order to switch jersey numbers, you have to buy out all the No. 15 jerseys in stock anywhere from the NFL. You’re stuck with the number until you do.

&gt; He’s still going through the rigamarole of making that happen. Hence, why he wore No. 15 during minicamp.

&gt; “It’s still crazy,” Ross said. “But it’s something I was passionate about. It’s not like I’m actually buying something that is useless or would throw away. I see it like somebody else purchasing like a diamond chain or something. I’m doing it based off something I really want. It’s actually, I do this for a living. It’s not like it’s a waste of money. It’s all planned out and something I wanted to do.”","Bengals WR John Ross on changing his jersey number: ""I get a chance to re-invent myself and re-create some of the old me.

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Buffalo Bills.**

**Offense**

Round | Player | Position | Year Drafted | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The first thing I always look at is the QB position, because you can’t win without one. Is there any QB that the Bills drafted in a later round that played for the Bills that could give this team a legitimate chance at competing? Joe Ferguson was a third round pick, but the drop-off between him and Kelly wasn’t worth it. If I was considering Daryle Lamonica’s entire career (all 12 seasons and not just the four that he played with Buffalo), I would’ve easily put him ahead of Kelly so that the first round spot is open for a Hall of Fame level talent, like OJ Simpson or Joe DeLamielleure. But, seeing as I’m only factoring in what they did with the team that drafted them, I opted against it. I had to burn the first round spot on a QB; fortunately, the Bills have a really good one in Jim Kelly.

Next, I always try and plug in the Hall of Famers. This one was easy- Thurman Thomas takes the second round spot, and Andre Reed takes the fourth round spot. As for making up the rest of the team, it’s a matter of looking at the rounds and seeing if your hands are tied at any spot. In the sixth round, this was the case; the only two guys that did anything of note with the Bills were Corbin Lacina and Dusty Zeigler, both of whom were offensive linemen. This means that the sixth round spot has to go on the offensive line. The same problem occurs in the fifth round; the only noteworthy player drafted that did anything with the Bills was Donnie Green, who’s on the offensive line. 

Only two rounds are free- the third and the seventh. I still have to fill a flex spot and an OL/TE spot. There were a few combinations to choose from. I could’ve gone with an offensive lineman in the third and a wide receiver in the seventh by choosing Glenn Parker (third) and Steve Johnson (seventh), or I could’ve gone with a wide receiver in the third and an offensive lineman in the seventh by choosing Don Beebe (third) and Howard Ballard (seventh). In the end, I went with Beebe and Ballard, simply because the drop-off from Steve Johnson to Don Beebe was less than the drop-off from Howard Ballard to Glenn Parker; plus, the offensive line would look less than stellar without Ballard, while the receiving core is still pretty good with Andre Reed. Jim Braxton was also an option here for the third round spot, but I opted for a second receiver over a second halfback.

**Defense:** Bruce Smith was the obvious call for the first round spot; he’s the all-time leader in sacks, and is the only Hall of Famer that the Bills drafted on defense that wound up playing for them. After that, I looked to see if there were any rounds where I was going to have my hands tied. In the sixth round, the Bills have only drafted three starters, and all three of them (John Skorupan, Arthur Moats, Keith Ellison) played linebacker, so the sixth round spot had to be a linebacker. Kyle Williams had to get the fifth round spot; he’s the only player to make a Pro Bowl that was drafted in the fifth round on defense, and he’s made six of them. Additionally, his 178 starts were far and away the top total of any of those players. This problem also occurred in the third round; Ben Williams was the only Pro Bowler drafted in that spot, and while Eugene Marve’s overall career wasn’t bad by any means, he only spent half of it in Buffalo.

After going through those four rounds, all three defensive line spots were taken. Now, it was about finding the best defensive backs possible, as well as the best remaining linebacker. Butch Byrd in the fourth round was a no-brainer; the only other fourth rounder of note was Terrence McGee, but much like Byrd, McGee was a defensive back, so using a fourth round spot on a DB was never a question. This left two possible combinations- a defensive back in the second round (Jairus Byrd or Nate Odomes) and a linebacker in the seventh round (Mike Stratton), or a linebacker in the second round (Darryl Talley) and a defensive back in the seventh round (Mike Nelms). In the end, the drop-off between Byrd/Odomes and Nelms was marginal, but the drop-off between Stratton (a member of an all-decade team) and Talley was somewhat big. So, I opted for that combination.

**/r/NFL Rates**

How good is this team? That’s where I want you guys to come in so that there’s an interactive element before we do the postseason voting in a month. Based on the roster that you saw, how far do you think this team can go? Will they be a first round exit, or will they make it all the way to the championship?

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18272414)**

Note that for seeding purposes, I’m going to split it up between the AFC and NFC, and will rank the teams 1-16 in each conference based off of their lifetime winning percentage.

**Final Thoughts**

There are definitely some weak links on this team. The offensive line could use some work, and John Skorupan at one of the starting linebacker spots isn’t necessarily ideal. However, this team could be really good when all is said and done. They’ve got a Hall of Fame quarterback with Hall of Fame weapons around him (it’s basically the early 90s Bills offense), and on defense, a defensive line with Bruce Smith, Kyle Williams, and Ben Williams is going to be tough to block. When everyone on the defensive line has made it to a Pro Bowl, has made it to a combined 18 Pro Bowls, and has a combined 265 sacks (unofficially), you know that’s going to be a tough out. Buffalo might be able to win a few games when the time comes in the tournament.

We’ll do the 7-on-7 team for the **Miami Dolphins** tomorrow at 12:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day at 12:00 ET for the next team’s roster.","/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7-Round Tournament: Buffalo Bills",post

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .)

ThatPackerFan,t3_c9hp2y,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 39: 1958 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 28-December 14, 1958

Teams: 12

1958 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1958 First Draft Pick: King Hill, Quarterback from Rice University (Chicago Cardinals)

1958 AP Most Valuable Player: Jim Brown, Fullback (Cleveland Browns)

1958 NFL Championship Game: Baltimore Colts (9-3-0) defeated New York Giants (9-3-0) 23-17 (OT) at Yankee Stadium in New York City, New York.

The 1958 season is regarded as a watershed year in which the popularity of professional football in the United States began to rival that of baseball in the public imagination. ""Professional football was beyond coming of age in 1958,"" one writer enthused, ""it was on an even plane with baseball as the game of the people.""

Stadium attendance was robust throughout the league, with crowds in excess of 100,000 twice filling the Los Angeles Coliseum to see the Los Angeles Rams, while the Detroit Lions  managed to sell a staggering 42,000 season tickets in advance of the 1958 campaign, ensuring home sellouts at Briggs Stadium.

The Western Conference race was over after ten games, with the Colts at 9–1, and the Bears and Rams mathematically eliminated at 6–4. The Colts lost their final 2 games on the road in California to finish at 9–3, a game ahead of Chicago and Los Angeles.

The Cleveland Browns led the Eastern Conference title race up until the final week. On December 14, the 9–2 Browns visited the 8–3 Giants. As a snowstorm swept over Yankee Stadium, the Browns' 10–3 lead gave way to a 10–10 tie game on Frank Gifford's pass to Bob Schnelker, which would still have suited Cleveland. The Giants' Pat Summerall missed a 31-yard field goal with 4:30  left. With 2 minutes to play, Summerall had another opportunity from 49 yards out, in inclement weather and connected for a 13–10 win. The Browns and Giants finished with 9–3 records, forcing a playoff for a trip to the championship game. The Giants would prevail in a 10-0 shutout at Yankee Stadium.

The 1958 NFL Championship Game has become widely known as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"". The game was played at Yankee Stadium in New York City, New York featuring an attendance of 64,185 with an estimated 45 million watching on television.

The game got off to a rough start for both teams. On Baltimore's first drive, New York linebacker Sam Huff forced a fumble while sacking Johnny Unitas. Defensive back Jimmy Patton recovered the ball at the Colts 37. One play later, Baltimore took the ball back when defensive end Gino Marchetti forced a recovered fumble from quarterback Don Heinrich. But all the Colts managed to do with their next drive was lose another turnover when a Unitas pass was picked off by Lindon Crow. After forcing a punt, Unitas completed a 60-yard pass to Lenny Moore at the Giants' 26-yard line. But Baltimore's drive was halted at the 19 and Steve Myhra's field goal attempt was blocked by Huff.

On the Giants next drive, Heinrich was replaced by Charley Conerly for the rest of the game. New York then drove to the Colts' 30-yard line, featuring a 38-yard run by Frank Gifford.

On third down, Conerly threw a pass to wide-open fullback Alex Webster, but he slipped before the ball arrived and it fell incomplete. Pat Summerall then kicked a 36-yard field goal to put New York on the board. In the second quarter, Baltimore defensive end Ray Krouse recovered a fumble from Gifford to set up a 2-yard touchdown run by Colts running back Alan Ameche. On their next drive, New York got a big scoring opportunity when they recovered a fumbled punt from Jackie Simpson on the Colts 10-yard line. But a few plays later, Gifford fumbled again, and Baltimore lineman Don Joyce recovered on his own 14. The Colts subsequently drove 86 yards in 15 plays, including a 16-yard scramble by Unitas on 3rd and 7, to score on Unitas' 15-yard touchdown pass to Raymond Berry, giving them a 14–3 halftime lead.

That fumble by Gifford and the fumble later were forced by defensive back Milt Davis of the Colts—despite playing with two broken bones in his right foot—and both led to touchdowns for the Colts.

Then early in the third quarter, Baltimore reached the New York 1-yard line. But on third down, Ameche was stopped for no gain, and the Colts turned it over on downs after Ameche was tackled trying to go wide at the 5-yard line on a great play by linebacker Cliff Livingston, on a fourth down halfback option play. It was a huge reversal of momentum.

The Giants then went 95-yards in just four plays, scoring on Mel Triplett's 1-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 4, with a score of 14–10. The drive was highlighted by an unforgettable 86-yard pass play from deep within the Giants own territory at the closed end of the stadium: Quarterback Conerly threw to Kyle Rote downfield left-to-right across the middle where Rote then broke an arm tackle at about mid-field; then Rote fumbled when hit from behind at the Colts 25, but Webster, who was trailing the play, picked up the ball and ran it all the way to the 1-yard line where he was knocked out of bounds.

The Giants took a 17–14 lead early in the fourth quarter with Conerly's 46-yard completion to tight end Bob Schnelker setting up his 15-yard touchdown pass to Gifford. On both of Baltimore's next drives they moved the ball into scoring range, but came up empty both times. First they drove to the Giants 39-yard line, only to have Bert Rechichar miss a 46-yard field goal. Then they got the ball back on the New York 42 following a fumble recovery by Joyce. But after driving to the 27-yard line, Unitas was sacked twice in a row (once by Andy Robustelli and once by Dick Modzelweski), moving the ball back 20 yards and pushing the Colts out of field goal range.

Faced with fourth down and inches on their own 40-yard on their ensuing drive, New York decided to punt with a little over two minutes left in the game (on the third down play before the punt, Marchetti was knocked out of the game with a broken ankle. He refused to leave for medical treatment and watched the rest of the game sitting up on a stretcher on the sidelines). The Colts took over at their own 14-yard line and Unitas engineered one of the most famous drives in football history—a 2-minute drill before anyone called it that. After starting the drive with two incompletions, Unitas made a critical 11-yard completion to Moore on third down. Following one more incompletion, he threw three consecutive passes to Berry, moving the ball 62 yards to the Giants 13-yard line. This set up a 20-yard tying field goal by Myhra with seven seconds left to send the game into sudden-death overtime—the first overtime game in NFL playoff history. As Unitas later stated, the players had never heard of overtime before the game. ""When the game ended in a tie, we were standing on the sidelines waiting to see what came next. All of a sudden, the officials came over and said, 'Send the captain out. We're going to flip a coin to see who will receive.' That was the first we heard of the overtime period."" An NFL preseason exhibition game played three years earlier in Portland, Oregon, had been settled by sudden-death overtime, but this was the first time an NFL game of any significance needed overtime to determine a winner. Bert Bell, the commissioner of the NFL, had just implemented the sudden-death overtime rule for this game.

The overtime rule stipulated that a coin toss would be held at midfield. The available player-captains of the respective teams would attend it and the visiting team would choose heads or tails. The winning side of the toss would choose whether to receive the ball or kick off. Unitas called for the Colts and lost the toss. With Marchetti injured and on the sidelines, head referee Ron Gibbs gave the instructions to Colt co-captain Unitas, and Giants' co-captains Rote and Bill Svoboda: 'The first team to score, field goal, safety, or touchdown, will win the game, and the game will be over.'

Don Maynard received the opening kickoff for the Giants and muffed the catch, but recovered it on the Giants 20-yard line. Even in his autobiography *You Can't Catch Sunshine*, Maynard states that he was not only disappointed in the botched attempt, but also at the commentators for saying he fumbled the ball due to their lack of knowledge of football and its terminology by not knowing the difference between a fumble and muffing the ball. After a *three-and-out series*, the Giants punted. On their ensuing drive, Baltimore drove 80 yards in 13 plays (all called by QB Johnny Unitas) on a tired NY defense. Ameche made several critical plays on the drive, catching an 8-yard pass on 3rd and 8 from the Colts 33, and later rushing 22 yards to the Giants 20-yard line. Berry also made a big impact, catching two passes for 33 yards, including a 12-yard reception on the New York 8. Following a 1-yard run by Ameche and a 6-yard catch by tight end Jim Mutscheller, Ameche scored on a third down 1-yard touchdown run with 6:45 left to win the game, 23–17.

This game stands as 1 of only 2 NFL title games to be decided in overtime, the next one wouldn't occur until Super Bowl LI between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it looks like the Cardinals, Browns, Titans and Chiefs all have dedicated mini series for their teams off seasons. Personally, I think this is something all teams should invest in, most fans  love the inside look at their favorite team, it's also kind of why hard knocks is so successful! I think it helps keep the fan connected and makes them feel like their apart of the team! Hope you all enjoy the rest of the off season.

&amp;#x200B;

Go Pack Go!

When I looked up the rules, it said that after an incomplete pass, the down is basically wasted and the play is restarted by the offense at the last line of scrimmage. However, in the above game that I was talking about, the offense started the play at the last line of scrimmage but it showed it was 1st and 10 yards... how is that possible? Shouldn't it have been 4rth and 7 yards?

Caulibflower,t3_c92e01,nfl,"The example that made me think of this is [John Jefferson.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jefferson) I found myself down a [PFR](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JeffJo00.htm) rabbithole the other day and was reminded of how big of a splash he made during a dominant first three years in the league as a Charger. He set a bunch of NFL and franchise records, but basically forced his way out of San Diego and never came close to matching that production elsewhere. Was out of the league by age 30. 

**For comparison's sake, Randy Moss's NFL ranks over his first three years:**

Year 1 (21) - 3rd rec yards, 1st rec TDs

Year 2 (22) - 3rd rec yards, T-6th rec TDs

Year 3 (23) - 5th rec yards, 1st rec TDs


**Now John Jefferson's NFL ranks by year:**

Year 1 (22) - 4th rec yards, 1st rec TDs

Year 2 (23) - 4th rec yards, 3rd rec TDs

Year 3 (24) - 1st rec yards, 1st rec TDs

**The Drop-Off (after leaving San Diego)** 

Year 4 (25) - 44th rec yards, T-40th rec TDs

Year 5 (26) - 28th rec yards, 0 rec TDs (while Wes Chandler crossed 1000 yards in 8 games in Jefferson's former role for San Diego)

Year 6 (27) - 22nd rec yards, 15th rec TDs

Year 7 (28) - 127th rec yards, 0 TDs

Year 8 (29) - 3 catches for 30 yards, 0 TDs

**Out of the League**


I should note - I'm not saying that ""no one remembers"" John Jefferson. But *I* wouldn't have known about him if I wasn't a stats nerd, because people don't talk about him as an all-time great - even though his relative impact on hitting the NFL was on a similar level to Randy Moss.",Who are some players who looked like Hall of Famers their first few years in the league... but faded too quickly to be remembered?,post

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

KingMeruem12,t3_c94bvc,nfl,"We know for a fact that teams like the Giants and Dolphins are probably not going to compete anytime soon. But what if we structured the divisions in a way where every team is competitive to win their division?

Divisions would be determined based on how you performed relative to the entire league. For example: one division would be the top 4 teams by record (Saints, Chiefs, Rams and Bears). As for determining which divisions are placed in which conference, I would alternate based on strength of division. For example: the division with the top 4 teams would be placed in one conference while the 5-8 best teams are placed in the other.

Based on last years results, here is what the new divisions for 2019 would look like:

**Conference 1:**

|*East*|*North*|*South*|*West*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Saints|Cowboys|Falcons|Bills|
|Rams|Seahawks|Redskins|Giants|
|Chiefs|Colts|Panthers|Jags|
|Bears|Steelers|Dolphins|Bucs|

&amp;#x200B;

**Conference 2:**

|*East*|*North*|*South*|*West*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chargers|Eagles|Packers|49ers|
|Patriots|TItans|Broncos|Jets|
|Texans|Vikings|Lions|Raiders|
|Ravens|Browns|Bengals|Cardinals|

&amp;#x200B;

In this system, teams like the Patriots wouldn't be shoo-ins for the playoffs every year and every team would be competitive to win their division. Every fanbase can be excited because their team actually has a chance of making the playoffs. Just an interesting way to up the competition.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 38: 1957 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 29-December 22, 1957

Teams: 12

1957 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1957 First Draft Pick: Paul Hornung, Halfback from the University of Notre Dame (Green Bay Packers)

1957 AP Most Valuable Player: Jim Brown, Fullback (Cleveland Browns)

1957 NFL Championship Game: Detroit Lions (8-4-0) defeated Cleveland Browns (9-2-1) 59-14 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, MI.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-During sudden-death overtime, rules for time outs are the same as in a regular game, including the last two minutes of the second and fourth quarters.

\-Home teams wore dark jerseys and road team wore white. Previously, NFL teams were allowed to wear whatever uniform color they liked, even if it clashed with the other team, and were not required to have a white jersey.

Cleveland won its opener, 6–3 over the Giants, and led the Eastern Conference from wire to wire. A 17–7 loss to the Eagles in Week 4 forced the Browns to share the lead with New York, but the Giants lost the following week, and spent the rest of the season trying to catch Cleveland, which they would not accomplish.

The Western Conference race was more protracted. Baltimore, Detroit, and San Francisco were tied for the lead several times, and had identical 7–4 records at the end of the penultimate week. When 2 teams tied for first place, they would meet in a one-game playoff. The NFL did have a provision for that: ""If all 3 teams win, tie, or lose, then a 2-week playoff series begins next Sunday with Baltimore drawing a bye, San Francisco playing Detroit, and the winner meeting the Colts at Baltimore Dec. 29."" Detroit and San Francisco both won their regular season finales while starting their backup quarterbacks (Tobin Rote and rookie John Brodie, respectively), but the Colts lost, so the additional playoff never took place.

As the standard with a tie, the tied teams would face off in a playoff game to advance to the championship game. The Lions and 49ers met in San Francisco at Kezar Stadium. The 49ers at led 24-7 at the half and later 27-7, appearing to be heading for the championship game the following week. The Lions however mounted a comeback, with back-up Tobin Rote leading the Lions to rally and put up 24 unanswered points to win the game 31-27 and advance. It is looked at as one of the earliest and most significant major comebacks in the league's history.

The 1957 NFL Championship Game took place at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, MI. The game was a rematch from the 3-peat seen earlier in the decade as these teams met in 1952, 1953, and 1954's championship games. The Browns came into the game favored by 3 points.

The home underdog Lions were without starting quarterback Layne due to a broken ankle 3 weeks earlier against the Browns. Backup quarterback Tobin Rote filled in admirably following Layne's injury, winning every game, including a 24-point rally in the playoff the week prior against the 49ers. In his 8th season, Rote threw 4 touchdown passes in the title game, completing 12 of 19 passes for 280 yards, and also ran for a touchdown. Browns quarterbacks Tommy O'Connell and Milt Plum, on the other hand hit on a combined total of 9 of 22 passes for 112 yards. Taking full advantage of a pass interception and a fumble, Detroit ran up a 17–0 lead in the 1st quarter. Rookie running back and league MVP Jim Brown gave the Cleveland rooters some hope with a 29-yard touchdown run at the start of the 2nd period.

Things went from bad to worse for the Browns, hampered by injuries to quarterbacks O'Connell and Plum. The Lions romped for 14 points in each of the last 3 quarters, and won by 45 points, 59–14. In their final 6 quarters of play (including their previous divisional playoff), the Lions outscored their opponents 83-17 during the finish of the 1957 season. 

Until 2006, this was the last time that major professional teams from Michigan and Ohio met in a postseason series or game. As of 2018, this was the last playoff game played in the city of Detroit other than Super Bowl XL in 2006. The Lions other two home playoff games since 1957 (1991 and 1993) were played at the Pontiac Silverdome in nearby Pontiac, MI.

Not only was this the most recent title for the Lions, it is also the last time they have appeared in a title game as of today. The closest they ever got to making it to the title game was in 1991 when they lost the NFC Championship game to the Washington Redskins.

Do they stack up on talent and find hidden gems in the back end? Are there certain positions where they strike gold every time, and are there certain positions where they strike out every time?

Well, much like we did with the [/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c7s9ez/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_series_finale/?st=jxntk091&amp;sh=bbea1a62), where we looked at the best draft spot of all-time when assembling a team, we’re going to take the next month to find out the answer to the aforementioned question.

It’s 7-on-7 football with a twist. Introducing the **/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7 Round Tournament.**

How this works is going to take some explaining, because it’s bit more in-depth than the last series where it was basically just picking the best players at each position from a certain draft spot. We’re going to go down the line of every single team in the NFL, and assemble the best roster for a game of 7-on-7 football. Each team will have seven players on offense and seven players on defense. The seven players on offense and seven players on defense will be different. Players are not going to be playing two ways in this tournament. It’s going to be a roster of 14 players, with seven on each side of the ball. Here’s what each roster will comprise of:

Offense | Defense
--- | ---
QB | DE
HB | DE
WR | LB
HB/WR/TE (flex) | LB
OL | DB
OL | DB
OL/TE | JOKER (can be any defensive position)

On defense, I can have three defensive backs, three linebackers, or three defensive linemen. It doesn’t matter. On offense, I must have a minimum of two offensive linemen, and then either a third offensive lineman or a tight end; I must also have a minimum of one halfback and receiver, and then can have either a second receiver, a second halfback, or a tight end. While certain positions are pretty strict in what I must have, I do have some flexibility in other areas.

As for the rules of the players, this is where it gets unique:

- **On each side of the ball, I can only use one player per draft round.** There are seven rounds in the draft. I can only use one player that was drafted in the first round, one player that was drafted in the second round, etc.; once a round is used on a side of the ball, I can’t use it anymore. As an example, both Warren Sapp and Lee Roy Selmon were drafted by the Buccaneers in the first round of the NFL Draft; I cannot put both of them on the Bucs’ team, because they were both first round picks.

- **The players that make up each team had to make a contribution to said team.** In other words, accomplishments with other teams don’t count. As an example, Brett Favre is an amazing quarterback, but I can’t use him as the second round choice on offense for the Falcons, because he did absolutely nothing with them. Even if you drafted someone, they had to make an impact with your team; accomplishments with other teams do not count.

- **Undrafted players are ineligible for this list.** The purpose of this is to see how teams fare with their draft picks. If I let UDFAs into this, it gets really complicated and messy. So guys like Wayne Chrebet and Tony Romo won’t feature on this list.

- **Special teams is excluded from this.** Much like the last tournament I ran, we’re going to assume no kicking and no punting.

- **There is no restriction on how many players from a particular draft can be used.** As an example, in 2016, the Jaguars drafted Jalen Ramsey in the first round, Myles Jack in the second round, and Yannick Ngakoue in the third round. If I wanted to, I could use all three of those players for the Jaguars, since they were all drafted in different rounds. The year is irrelevant.

- **The seventh round slot includes any round past round seven.** The NFL Draft used to be longer than seven rounds. So, if I wanted to use a player from round eight, nine, or any other round past the seventh round, I can do that for that seventh round slot. It’s rounds 1-6, and round 7+.

- **Draft trades don’t count.** It just gets too messy if I do that. Philip Rivers doesn’t count for the Chargers, Eli Manning doesn’t count for the Giants, John Elway doesn’t count for the Broncos… you get the idea. Along the same lines, free agency doesn’t count; you had to be the one to draft that player. In other words, Drew Brees can’t play for the Saints.

- **I’m only counting the common draft.** Expansion drafts, supplemental drafts, and the USFL draft do not count.

Perhaps the most important thing to understand is that **this is not a series stating the best player ever drafted by each team in each round.** A lot of times, the best player drafted by a team at a certain spot won’t be on the list, because it’s about assembling the best team, and if I put said player on the list, it wouldn’t work. An example of this will be with the Ravens. I think everyone can agree that Jonathan Ogden is a better player than Joe Flacco, but I have to put Flacco at that first round spot over Ogden, because if I didn’t put Flacco there, the team would completely fall apart and would have no quarterback (I couldn’t use Tyrod Taylor because he did nothing in Baltimore). There are going to be lots of Hall of Famers that are off this list, and a lot of mediocre players that are on. At the end of the day, it’s about assembling the best team possible, not the best collection of players possible (with the Ravens, even though Ogden is the best offensive player ever taken by them, I’d rather have a team with Flacco and a worse offensive line than a team with Ogden and Chris Redman at quarterback). It’s a giant balancing act.

The other cool thing about this series is that with the last one, there wasn’t a whole lot of debate for spots. Maybe there were a few spots that were up in the air, but with a lot of the players, they were shoo-ins for their position. With this, you could legitimately assemble an entirely different team than me if you wanted to. If you value certain positions and certain players over others, you could go about this an entirely different way. If you would rather have a Hall of Fame player and mediocre players on one team instead of a collection of very good players, you can do that. This series is up for debate in terms of crafting your team.

So, with all of that said, here’s what the schedule of events should look like if everything goes to plan (it should take us to the end of the first week of the preseason):

- **7/3:** Introduction to the Series

- **7/5-7/8:** AFC East Teams

- **7/9-7/12:** NFC East Teams

- **7/13-7/16:** AFC South Teams

- **7/17-7/20:** NFC South Teams

- **7/21-7/24:** AFC North Teams

- **7/25-7/28:** NFC North Teams

- **7/29-8/1:** AFC West Teams

- **8/2-8/5:** NFC West Teams

- **8/6-8/7:** Round of 32 Voting

- **8/8:** Sweet 16 Voting

- **8/9:** Elite Eight Voting

- **8/10:** Final Four Voting

- **8/11:** Championship Sunday

- **8/12:** Conclusion of the Series/Winner is Announced

We’re going to take the Fourth of July off and start this series on Friday. The last series went really well, and you guys seemed to be really engaged in that, so I’m excited to see how this one does. And, much like last series, I'll have a hub that's frequently updated so you can see every post if you ever miss one.

Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/tayborsnapping

My name is Taybor Pepper and I am currently competing for the Long Snapping spot at the New York Giants. I also played for the Green Bay Packers in 2017. I played 54 games in college at Michigan State and won:

2012 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl
2013 Big Ten Championship
2014 Rose Bowl
2015 Cotton Bowl
2015 Big Ten Championship

In addition to pursuing a career as a professional athlete, I have been streaming on Twitch for the past 6 months. I pride myself on the fact that when people tune into my channel they are surprised that a professional athlete knows so much about Twitch/gaming culture. I regularly game with streamers who consistently have a reach of 5,000+ concurrent viewers. Some of the streamers that I interact with regularly are Pokimane, Hasan Piker, Destiny, Trainwrecks, Xqc, and Rajj Patel.

I would like to build my Twitch channel to the point where I could gracefully transition my football career into a full time streaming career when my time as a player has run its course.

legerb2214,t3_c8hx7m,nfl,"Today, as I sifted through the endless geopolitical ramifications of the sugar trade at work, a barrage of questions ran through my head. Should I make a change in my life? Should I start exercising more and catch up on things I need to do at home? Is this what it feels like to be a responsible adult? What happens when the entire NFL finds itself completely tied? Like completely tied, like motherfucker triple-double knotted a shoe tied? Like Cincinnati Royals 1962-63 Dan **Tie**man tied?

We're talking about every team having the same record, points, touchdowns, yards, SoS, interceptions and domestic violence incidents. **Everything is motherfucking equal -including net points-.** Well I wanted to know and I figured other people did too, so let me tell y'all what a quick 5 minute google search told me.

First lets set some parameters. Now y'all might be thinking that every team would go 0-0-16 in a league of full parity, however, y'all motherfuckers would be wrong. **8-8 is the one true record**. That's right I said it.

1. First of all 8 wins and 8 losses is a tie
2. A tie counts as half a win and half a loss so an 0-0-16 is the same record anyway according to the big man upstairs
3. I don't give a shit

So now that that's settled, the second parameter is that the Texans win the Superbowl in this scenario because I am heavily biased. Oh and the Colts finish last in the division and maybe the Patriots too because I don't like losing to them every year (seriously we've only won a game against them in our existence as a franchise)

That's it.

So let's zoom into the final game of the season. Here the Raiders and Broncos fight in what will be the ultimate determining game of the season. The game comes down to one final drive, 2 hours after all of the other games have ended despite 2 other games starting at 3:25 due to a ref mutiny midway through the second quarter wherein one ref decided to let each coach have unlimited challenges. Also, who wouldn't want a primetime Raiders-Broncos game? The Raiders lose due to a block in the back call in the endzone of an intercepted hail mary forcing a safety.

DOOMSDAY HAS NOW BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT!!! ALL TEAMS 8-8!!!

Suddenly, we find ourselves in a completely unfamiliar and quite frankly scary situation. **Every team is now 8-8.** What the fuck happens now? Do we riot? Do we tell our deepest darkest secrets to me, a trustworthy individual? Do we do a little dance, make a little love, and get down tonight? Nah. We consult the NFL rule book. That right its tiebreaker time.

For the division:

1. ~~Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games among the clubs)~~
2. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division~~
3. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games~~
4. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference~~
5. ~~Strength of victory~~
6. ~~Strength of schedule~~
7. ~~Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed~~
8. ~~Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed~~
9. ~~Best net points in common games~~
10. ~~Best net points in all games~~
11. ~~Best net touchdowns in all games~~
12. ***A*** ***Coin toss***

That's right motherfuckers. **Random Chance** is the only true determinate. That brings me to my second point. The NFL is Harvey Dent from the Dark Knight, but that's a story for a different post.

Now, let's check out Wild Card matchups:

1. ~~Apply the division tiebreaker to eliminate all but the highest-ranked club in each division prior to proceeding to step 2. The original seeding within a division upon application of the division tiebreaker remains the same for all subsequent applications of the procedure that are necessary to identify the two wild card participants.~~
2. ~~Head-to-head sweep (applicable only if one club has defeated each of the others or if one club has lost to each of the others)~~
3. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference~~
4. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games, minimum of four~~
5. ~~Strength of victory~~
6. ~~Strength of schedule~~
7. ~~Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed~~
8. ~~Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed~~
9. ~~Best net points in conference games~~
10. ~~Best net points in all games~~
11. ~~Best net touchdowns in all games~~
12. ***A Coin toss***

We meet our one true god again. Coin Toss baby. Some of y'all might be wondering what about the seeding and I counter that with who the fuck cares. I mean at this point you kinda know. It's going to be a coin toss.

In conclusion, Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Goodell? I don’t have a plan … a normal person has plans. competently run organizations have plans. You know what I am, Goodell? I am a dog chasing cars… I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it. I just do things. I am just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans. Yours, theirs, everyone’s. Tony Romo has plans. Even my father has plans. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I am not a schemer. I show the schemer how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say that you and the game of football was nothing personal, you know I am telling the truth. I just did what I do best. I took your plan and turned it on itself. Look what I have done to this city with a poorly written reddit post. Nobody panics when the expected people gets killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow Tom Brady bathes in the blood on newborns to maintain his youth, nobody panics. – because it’s all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old complete 8-8 season would happen, everybody loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I am an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos Goodell? IT is FAIR.

Note: There are a few teams, such as the Patriots and 49ers, that either don't have an OC/DC, or the head coach carries that title. I understand that actual responsibility of OC/DC varies greatly based off the background of their respective HC, and some coordinator's might get too much, or not enough credit for their side of the ball.",[OC] I ranked very current coordinator by their average finish in points,post

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

ThatPackerFan,t3_c8t13n,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 37: 1956 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 30-December 23, 1956

Teams: 12

1956 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1956 First Draft Pick: Gary Glick, Safety from Colorado A&amp;M (Pittsburgh Steelers)

1956 NFL Championship Game: New York Giants (8-3-1) defeated Chicago Bears (9-2-1) 47-7 at Yankee Stadium in New York City, New York.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-It is now illegal to grab an opponent's facemask (other than the ball carrier).

\-Using radio receivers to communicate with players on the field is prohibited.

\-The ball for night games was changed from white with black stripes to brown with white stripes.

With DuMont no longer airing games, CBS was brought in and began airing games during the regular season along with NBC (who still broadcast the title game).

The Chicago Cardinals got off to their best start ever, going 4–0, until the Redskins beat them 17–14 on October 28. At the midway point, they and the Giants had 5–1 records. In the Western Conference, the Detroit Lions roared to a 6–0 start. In Week 7 (November 11), the Giants pulled ahead with a 23–10 win over the Cards. In Washington, the Lions finally lost. Trapped on his own 1-yard line, Yale Lary took a safety in order to get a free kick. That, and Sam Baker's field goal, gave the Redskins an 18–10 lead to put the game out of reach, and the Lions lost 18–17. The Bears, who had dropped their opener at Baltimore, 28–21, beat Green Bay 38–14 for their 6th straight game, matching Detroit's 6–1 record.

In Week 9, the Lions dropped their Thanksgiving Day game as Tobin Rote guided Green Bay to 3 4th quarter touchdowns in a 24–20 win. On Sunday, the Cards 38–27 win over Pittsburgh put them a half game out. The Bears cancelled a loss, while the Giants watched a win elude them, as Harlon Hill caught a last-ditch 56-yard touchdown pass from Ed Brown in tying the Giants, 17–17. Both the Bears and the Giants continued to lead their conferences, but only by half a game.

The Cards lost the next 2 games and any chance at the Eastern title, which the Giants clinched, in part because of a 28–14 win over Washington on December 2. The Western race came down to the Bears and Lions. In Week 10 (December 2), the Lions hosted the Bears and won 42–10, to take the lead. When both teams won the following week, the trip to the championship came down to December 16, the last game of the season, which would have the 9–2 Detroit Lions visiting the 8–2–1 Chicago Bears, who hadn't forgotten the earlier drubbing. The game at Wrigley Field was marked by numerous fights, including a 4th quarter melee involving players, fans, and the police, and a vicious hit well behind the play by the Bears' Ed Meadows that knocked Detroit quarterback Bobby Layne out of the game with a concussion. So, the Bears exacted their revenge with a 38–21 victory. After the game Lions' coach Buddy Parker appealed to the commissioner to punish what the Lions felt was the dirty play of George Halas' Bears, but no ruling was forthcoming.

The 1956 NFL Championship Game would feature 2 teams who were no strangers to the title game. It was the first NFL title game in over half a decade to not feature the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, or Los Angeles Rams. It was also the first appearance in a title game for the Bears and Giants since the 1946 game at the Polo Grounds in New York.

The 1956 Giants featured a number of Hall of Fame players, including running backs Frank Gifford and Alex Webster, offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown, linebacker Sam Huff, and defensive end Andy Robustelli. Two assistants of Giants head coach Jim Lee Howell, offensive coordinator Vince Lombardi and defensive coordinator Tom Landry, later became Hall of Fame head coaches with other franchises; Lombardi coached the Green Bay Packers to 5 NFL titles in the 1960s whil Landry led the Dallas Cowboys to 5 Super Bowls, with 2 wins during the 1970s.

The game was played on an icy field, with temperatures hovering around 20 °F (−7 °C). To adjust to the slick conditions, the Giants opted to wear sneakers instead of traditional football cleats. The advantage the white sneakers provided in footing was cited as a major factor in New York's romp. 22 years earlier on an icy Polo Grounds field, the Giants had employed the same tactic and beat the Bears to win the 1934 NFL Championship Game in the famous ""Sneakers Game"".

The Giants led 13–0 after the 1st quarter and built a 34–7 halftime lead on their way to a 47–7 win before 56,836. Although the home team, the Giants wore their white jerseys and the Bears their navy blue. New York's custom at the time was to alternate between blue and white jerseys at home. The blue jerseys were designated as the ""home jerseys"" beginning in 1957.

The 1956 NFL title was the Giants' 4th; they played in 5 of the 6 title games from 1958 through 1963, but did not win any of them. After the 1956 title, it was another 30 years before their next, Super Bowl XXI in January 1987.

His agent speaks into his ear (which you can clearly hear on the video) that the Broncos are moving to 2...and says with a smile.  Obviously this didnt happen which means it was contingent but the only contengency one could project that would make sense now that the draft is over is if the Browns took Barkley (who the Giants drafted) then the Giants move out of 2 and the Broncos take Mayfield.   The agent would not have such a reaction, nor would Mayfield if they didnt think that move was to take Mayfield.

RentalCut,t3_c8hd2g,nfl,"This post is sort of a sequel to the one I posted about [the 2018 draft a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b54707/oc_a_look_at_the_early_returns_of_every_teams/), in which I ranked every team's 2018 draft class by their collective AV (Approximate Value) after their rookie seasons. People seemed to really like the post, but a common criticism (and something I also started thinking in the midst of putting together the post) was that that the sample size just isn't big enough to properly rank those classes using this methodology just yet. So instead, I'm going to rank every team's 2014 draft class with it. I chose this class in particular because it's the latest season in which all 256 draftees are officially off their rookie contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

Some quick notes on my process and how I did things:

* I recorded every player's AV for every season they were with the team that drafted them and only those seasons. For example, I did not give the Saints any credit for anything Brandin Cooks did as a member of the Patriots or Rams.
* If a player was traded or cut by the team that drafted them and contributed on a different team later in the season, I only recorded the AV they earned on the team they were drafted by. For example, the Panthers traded Kelvin Benjamin in the middle of the 2017 season, so I only gave the Panthers the AV Benjamin earned as a member of the Panthers that season.
* If a player returned to the team they were drafted by after spending time on a different team, I decided to include the AV they culminated in their second stint with their original team (Jordan Matthews), as that's not really much different from 2nd-7th round picks who were playing on their second contract with their original team in their fifth season (Derek Carr).
* I included 0 un-drafted players because I have no intention of opening up that can of worms.
* I also did not include any players who were already in the NFL that a team may have acquired by trading 2014 draft picks for for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here are the results:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|*Rank*|*Team*|*Total AV*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Jacksonville Jaguars|174|
|2|Oakland Raiders|167|
|3|St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams|142|
|4|Dallas Cowboys|119|

&amp;#x200B;

On my 2018 post, some suggested that I try and come up with a way to quantify how worthwhile a draftee was based on *where* they were picked in the draft, and how well a team drafted as a whole based on the value of their draft picks. To do this, I came up with the super crazy formula of **AV (Approximate Value) - EV (Expected Value) = NV (Net Value).** To quantify expected value, I just took the pick values from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/ay4m0z/7_round_mock_template_free_to_all_that_wish_to/) mock draft template and simply divided them by 40. Why divide by 40 you may ask? I simply just thought that when I divided by 40, it looked/scaled most closely to regular AV (I'm sure there is a much better way to do this and I'm totally open to hearing any suggestions in the comments). This is what the EV of the top 10 picks came out to be when I did this:

&amp;#x200B;

|*Pick*|*Expected Value*|
|:-|:-|
|1|75|
|2|65|
|3|55|
|4|45|
|5|42.5|
|6|40|
|7|37.5|
|8|35|
|9|33.75|
|10|33.5|

...and so on. You can find the entire chart with the EV of all 256 picks in the spreadsheet I linked in the bottom of the post.

I should clarify, I personally look at EV as the expected value a player will provide over the entirety of their career, not just the first five years. This is why the #1 overall pick's EV is at a ridiculously high 75 for instance, and why the Texans rank much lower when adding this extra layer in spite of drafting a great player at #1 in Jadeveon Clowney- it takes more than just five really good seasons to return value as a #1 overall pick. The Rams also take a dive here due to #2 pick Greg Robinson busting, in spite of Aaron Donald doing his best to cancel him out.

So here are the results, along with each teams best value pick:

&amp;#x200B;

|*Rank*|*Team*|*Net Value*|*Best Value*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Oakland Raiders|101.408|Derek Carr|
|2|Jacksonville Jaguars|91.078|Telvin Smith|

|6|Washington Redskins|67.750|Morgan Moses|
|7|Tennessee Titans|60.505|Avery Williamson|
|8|Kansas City Chiefs|55.940|Zach Fulton|
|9|Carolina Panthers|55.078|Trai Turner|
|10|Atlanta Falcons|52.810|Devonta Freeman|
|11|Minnesota Vikings|49.790|Shamar Stephen|
|12|New York Giants|49.583|Devon Kennard|
|13|Chicago Bears|45.025|Charles Leno Jr.|

By all accounts they were the favorites to win it all. They even seemed to be getting the best of the Patriots in their playoff game, but just made a few crucial errors and wound up losing by 3 points, prompting the infamous L.T. confrontation of the Pat's players doing the lights out dance and L.T. going on to call the team and their coach classes in post-game interviews.

BUT... if the Chargers had won that game and gone on to make it to the SB to face the Rex Grossman lead Bears, there's a really good chance they would have won that game. Which would have meant that the 2004 Draft's 1st round QBs would have all gone on to win SBs for the following three years.

And last but not least, I’ve seen a fuckton more Texans fans when they play here rather than Dallas fans when they play here. 

So my questions are:

1. Who is the most popular team in Texas?

2. If the Cowboys aren’t even the most popular team in their own state, how the actual fuck am I supposed to believe they’re “America’s Team?”",Who is more popular in TX...the Cowboys or Texans?,post

did_cparkey_miss,t3_c8gkft,nfl,"Von Miller won a SB by himself dominating the Pats + Panthers, but anyone else notice how elite pass rushers generally are neutralized in the playoffs? 

Explanations I could think of include better o lines in the playoffs, teams using double teams to scheme them out of games, getting rid of the ball quicker, or pass rushers generally being worn down by the end of the season.

Just looking at this past years playoffs is illustrative:

Mack - neutralized by Eagles tackles including many 1 on 1’s 

Donald - neutralized by the Pats interior in the super bowl including many 1 on 1’s

Cox - neutralized by Bears o line

Jordan - Rams + Eagles o lines neutralized him 

Lawrence - shut down by Rams tackles

JJ watt - didn’t impact the colts game much; many 1 on 1’s he didn’t win.

Ingram + Bosa - shut down by Pats o line 

Curious as to what you all think, and if you agree   / disagree why you believe that to be the case. From what I’m seeing Von Miller appears to be the exception.",Anyone notice / have an explanation for why top tier pass rushers (aside from 2015 Von Miller) get neutralized in the playoffs?,post

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

ThatPackerFan,t3_c8drrs,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 36: 1955 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 24-December 11, 1955

Teams: 12

1955 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1955 First Draft Pick: George Shaw, Running Back from the University of Oregon (Baltimore Colts)

1955 NFL Championship Game: Cleveland Browns (9-2-1) defeated Los Angeles Rams (8-3-1)  38-14 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The ball is dead immediately when the ball carrier touches the ground with any part of his body except his hands or feet while in the grasp of an opponent.

\-A new exception is made in regard to scoring a safety: When a defender intercepts a pass, his intercepting momentum carries him into his own end zone, and he is stopped before returning the ball back into the field of play, then the ball will be next put in play at the spot of the interception.

The NFL, after using the DuMont Television Network for the airing of games, was offered $100,000 from NBC to allow them to broadcast the NFL Championship Game at the conclusion of the season, this being the first big move in the league being nationally televised throughout the season.

The defending champion Browns dropped their opener, at home, to the Redskins 27–17, but a 6-game win streak put them back in front to win the Eastern race. The Western race was crowded a few times, as the Rams had to share the lead. In Week 8, the Bears beat Los Angeles 24–3, to give both teams 5–3 records, The next week (November 20), the Bears took the lead with a 24–14 at Detroit while the Rams got a 17–17 tie at Baltimore. As had happened many times before in the annual battle of Chicago, the Bears were upset by the Cardinals in Week 10 (November 27), 53–14; the Rams eked out a 23–21 in Philadelphia on Les Richter's field goal with 0:07 left in the game. In Week 11 (December 4), the Rams won 20–14 over Baltimore, and the Bears kept their hopes alive with a difficult 21–20 win over Detroit. In the latter game, the Lions' Doak Walker missed an extra point, lost a fumble late in the game on the Detroit 28, and was wide on a 35-yard field goal attempt in the final seconds. The Bears won their last game (December 11), 17–10 over Philadelphia, to finish 8–4, and hoped the 7–3–1 Rams would lose their game in Los Angeles against Green Bay. The Rams did not lose, clinching a spot in the title game, with a 31–17 win.

The 1955 NFL Championship Game once again featured the Cleveland Browns, taking on the Los Angeles Rams. This was a rematch from the 1950 and 1951 NFL Championship Games, which the teams split 1-1. The game took place in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The attendance of 87,695 broke the NFL championship game record by nearly 30,000. This was the first NFL championship game played on a Monday and the first televised by NBC. In their 6th consecutive NFL title game, the Browns were 6-point favorites.

As the game started, Browns veteran Lou Groza kicked off; Rams rookie halfback Ron Waller returned the kick, and Groza himself made the tackle. A subsequent Rams drive was stopped at the Cleveland 12 when Kenny Konz intercepted a Norm Van Brocklin pass.

Browns quarterback Otto Graham, who had announced his retirement at the end of the season, drove Cleveland to the L.A. 26 where Groza's FG gave the Browns a 3–0 first quarter lead. The Browns scored again when DB Don Paul intercepted Van Brocklin's pass on the Browns 35 and raced 65 yards for a touchdown, making the score 10–0.

The Rams answered back when Van Brocklin connected with halfback Volney ""Skeet"" Quinlan for a 67-yard touchdown, pulling the Rams to within 3 points, 10–7, and giving the large crowd hopes of an upset. But late in the second period, Van Brocklin threw his third interception of the half; defensive back Tom James, who had been beaten on the Rams' Tom Fears' title-winning touchdown on the same field 4 years earlier, grabbed the errant pass and took the ball back to midfield with time running out. The next play turned a close game into a rout; Otto Graham found Dante Lavelli with a 50-yard touchdown pass along the sideline and the Rams, who moments earlier were driving to take the lead, went to the locker room down 17–7.

With a 10-point lead coming out of the locker room, Graham earned his place as the star of the game. After moving the Browns from the L.A. 46, Graham kept the ball and ran around right end from the 19 and scored to put the Browns ahead 24–7. On Los Angeles's next possession, Sam Palumbo intercepted Van Brocklin at the Ram 36. Graham drove the Browns to the 4, then scored himself on a sneak. Groza's conversion increased Cleveland's lead to 31–7 with two minutes left in the third quarter.

In the final period, Graham tossed a 35-yard touchdown pass to Ray Renfro and Groza's kick gave the Browns a 38–7 lead. Late in the game, Waller ran four yards for a touchdown and Les Richter's conversion finished the scoring. In the final minutes coach Brown sent in reserve quarterback George Ratterman and allowed Graham to leave the field to an ovation from the Los Angeles crowd.

Cleveland, with its 3rd title of the decade, represented the American/Eastern Conference in the championship game every year since its admission to the NFL, celebrated Graham's farewell. The Rams' Van Brocklin, who threw 6 interceptions, often was quoted that it was the worst game of his Hall of Fame career.

The Browns would not win another title until the 1964 season, that also stands as their most recent NFL Championship. The Rams wouldn't appear in another title game until 1980 in Super Bowl XIV.

RonanB17,t3_c7y14m,nfl,"October 11, 1959. Franklin Field, Philadelphia Pennsylvania. The 1-1 Eagles are playing host to the 1-1 Steelers. 27,343 people are in the bleachers to see this game. A few of those people here this afternoon are Commissioner Bert Bell and his family. You see Bell once owned (and coached) both the Steelers and Eagles. Because of his former tenure as owner and coach, the Eagles offered Bell a set of box seats for him and his family but the Commissioner refused, instead buying end zone tickets and sitting with the fans. Bert Bell loved football. In 1959, his dear friend and Giants owner Tim Mara passed away, and the news of this upset Bell so much he suffered a heart attack. Bell survived but his doctors advised him to avoid stress as much as possible, even going so far as to recommend he stop watching the league he governed. In response to this Bell is said to have responded, “I’d rather die watching football than in bed with my boots off.” Bell is here along with 27,000 others to enjoy a Sunday afternoon spectating the sport and teams they love. 

The game progresses as many normal games do. It’s 21-17 Philadelphia in the 4th quarter, and the Eagles are driving. The Eagles reach the 18 and something happens that after some research I can’t exactly determine the order of events. The two things that happened were that Norm Van Brocklin hit Tommy MacDonald for a game-sealing touchdown pass, and Bert Bell, the man who engineered the merger between the NFL and AAFC, is having what will become a fatal heart attack in the bleachers. So one of two orders must be true.

1. Van Brocklin’s touchdown pass gets Bell so excited he has the heart attack 

*or*

2. Bell has the heart attack, and the reaction of the crowd throws the players on the field off, and the Eagles capitalize resulting in a touchdown

Now I for one refuse to believe an NFL defense got distracted by crowd screaming so much they let a TD pass by, so I personally subscribe to theory 1. 

But the tragic death of Bert Bell is not the end of this story. Following his death, Austin Gunsel was named interim Commissioner until the owners meetings the following year where an election would be held. At these meetings, 49ers Attorney Marshall Leahy would defeat Gunsel 7-5 but fail to get the 2/3 majority needed to win the election. He had strong opposition due to his wish to move the league office from Philadelphia to San Francisco, so a whopping 21 “compromise” candidates being brought forth but none passing the 2/3 threshold. Finally, after 8 days the owners presented their 23rd candidate. He was the GM of the LA Rams at the time and promised to instead move the league office to New York. Thus, with an 8-1 vote with three abstentions, Pete Rozelle was elected to be the 8th head of the NFL. Over the next three decades Rozelle, through the exploding medium of television, and a merger with the innovative and burgeoning AFL, would firmly implant football as America’s game, resulting in the entertainment behemoth we all glue our eyes to every fall Sunday.",The Meaningless Game that Changed Everything,post

And for some, it can be the beginning of a long and painful downward spiral.  I am here to tell you four tales of how some of the biggest blunders have affected the careers of those involved.

In S.T.E.'s video he covers two plays The Minneapolis Miracle and Wide Left ('15 SEA-MIN Wild Card).  As such I will not be covering those plays as it's only fair to his work he put in his video.  Alright, let's begin.


#Super Bowl XLIX Interception (2014) - Russell Wilson and Ricardo Lockette

We start off with a play that I know quite well.  One most Seahawks fans will never forget.  The Infamous Interception that ended the Seahawks repeat hopes in one swift blow.  For this play we have two players to look at: Russell Wilson and Ricardo Lockette.  

**Russell Wilson**

The 2013 and 2014 Seahawks were one of the best and most balanced NFL teams this decade.  Wilson quickly showed himself to be a talented QB, accompanied by offensive threats of Lynch and Baldwin, Talented O-Lineman in Unger and Okung (when healthy) and a menacing defense led by the L.O.B.  It was a group to be feared.  Wilson's pick was the beginning of the end, you all know the story. The major parts of our defense (The L.O.B., Bennett, and Avril) began to collapse due to a mix of aging, injuries, cap, and in-fighting.  The O-Line became absolute garbage under Cable, and The running game would enter a three year phase of dysfunction and inefficiency

The one player to stand out from the decline was Russell Wilson.  He stepped to become one of the best QB's in the NFL.  He broke NFL records in 2015, played all 16 games under heavy physical duress in 2016, and he *was* our offense in 2017.  In the four years since his interception, he ranks 2nd in Passing TD's (Tied with Brees at 124) and ranks 4th in Passer Rating (min. 20 starts).  If anything, Wilson's become even better since XLIX.  

**Ricardo Lockette**

Lockette was not nearly as fortunate as Wilson.  A backup wide receiver for most of his career he never truly got his time to shine and didn't have the same reputation that stars like Baldwin or even backups like Kearse had.  Halfway through the 2015 season, Lockette collided with Cowboys safety, Jeff Heath, knocking him out of the game with a nasty neck injury. Lockette's injuries would keep him out of football and led him to retire next offseason.

#The Fumble - 1987 AFC Championship (CLE vs. DEN) - Earnest Byner 

Despite the infamous reputation of the play, Byner would go on to have some of his best years *after* his infamous drop. After one additional season in Cleveland, he would be traded to the Redskins in 1989.  He proved himself to be a valuable asset making the Pro Bowl for Washington in 1990.  

But Byner's true redemption occurred in 1991.   In his only All-Pro season, he would lead the Redskins to a Super Bowl Title.  Byner had finally achieved the success that slipped out of his hands 4 seasons before.  In 1994, he would return to Cleveland, playing for the original Browns during their final years and then concluded his career the Baltimore Ravens, retiring at the accomplished age of 35.  

#One Yard Short - Super Bowl XXXIV (1999) - Kevin Dyson

Kevin Dyson had a fairly uneventful career.  He only started 16 games twice during his career and never made it past 825 Rec. Yards in a season  Dyson's is most commonly remembered for his actions during the 1999 playoffs.  In the Wild Card Round, he caught the legendary lateral of the Music City Miracle and rode all the way to the Super Bowl.  But just as the magical run began with Dyson, it also ended on the hands of Dyson.  It was all on the line for the Titans, their last shot to score a TD and tie the Rams in the Super Bowl.  With a last ditch pass from Steve McNair, Kevin Dyson raced for the end zone...but fell just short, through a legendary tackle by Mike Jones.  Ending the Titans hope for a Lombardi Trophy

After 1999, Dyson would only manage a measly 1,404 Receiving Yards and 12 Receiving TD's over his next four seasons.   Dyson never really panned out as a first rounder and retired after failing to make any team after 2003.  The Titans receiving game was helmed admirably by Derrick Mason and Frank Wychek during Dyson's career and was supplemented by talented players like McNair and Eddie George, so he never really had a chance 

#""The Sickest Man in America"" - Super Bowl XIII (1978) - Jackie Smith

We finish off with Jackie Smith, a man with one of the most tragic careers of any NFL player.  He ranks among the greatest tight ends of all-time.  Names like Tony Gonzalez, Antonio Gates, Ozzie Newsome, the *good* Kellen Winslow, and John Mackey. 
 He was a truly revolutionary for the tight end position, establishing many of the first records for a Tight End and he truly earned his spot in Canton. Unfortunately, playoff success never matched his level of talent.

He played 15 seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals.  He only made the playoffs twice in that span, going one-and-done in both campaigns, ultimately retiring in 1977.  He would have simply been fine there.  Many players have had great careers with little playoff success (Larry Fitzgerald, Barry Sanders, Joe Thomas).  But then 1978 comes along.  Smith, 38 at the time, was contacted by the Cowboys.  Depth TE, Jay Saldi went down with a broken arm and they needed a replacement for him.  Smith was the perfect man for the job.  With Dallas, Smith mainly played as a blocking tight end on goal line plays.  Not really up to snuff with his previous work but he was finally on a contenter and one who had playoff experience.  His choice paid off as the Cowboys made it all the way to the Super Bowl.  

Trailing the Steelers in the 3rd quarter.  The Cowboys lined up at the goal-line looking to tie the game. Smith became open in the end zone.  A clear shot for Roger Staubach.  The ball was heading directly for Smith's hands, an almost sure-fire TD ...and Smith dropped it.  It fell right out of his hands  The Cowboys would end up losing the game and while their were multiple reasons for the loss, a lot of fingers were pointed at Smith and his untimely drop

 But there was no redemption for Smith.  He retired after the Super Bowl with the final note of his career being a tragic play to match an equally tragic career

Overall, the mistakes of a player last for a while.  Despite that, the fate of a players career lies solely on them.  They can proceed to have a normal career afterwards,maybe even become a better player from it.  A bad mistake is not the end all-be all for a player and they can still have a good career despite their low points",[OC] The Legacy of Tragedy: The Aftermath of the Players Behind NFL's Biggest Mistakes,post
KingMeruem12,t3_c8e8ac,nfl,"*The two examples I will use come from arguably the 2 greatest quarterbacks of all time and are actually very symbolic of their careers. Peyton Manning’s perfect 158.3 passer rating vs. the Broncos in the 2003 playoffs. And Tom Brady orchestrating arguably the greatest comeback in NFL history against the Falcons in Super Bowl 51.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Manning vs. Broncos: 2003 WC Round**

By halftime the Colts were up 31-3. They started the game with four straight touchdowns and ended the half with a fifth consecutive scoring drive (field goal). After the half, the Colts came out with yet another touchdown making it six straight scoring drives to start the game. After this drive, which put the Colts up 38-3, Manning was done with 5:24 left in the 3rd quarter. He only attempted 1 more pass for the rest of the game (6 yard completion to Marvin Harrison). In fact the Colts didn’t punt the ball at all during the game.  Had the Colts kept their foot on the gas the entire game, they were on pace for 58 points over a 60 minute game.

Peyton Manning was 22/26 for 377 yards and 5 TD and of course a perfect 158.3 passer rating. He had more touchdowns than incompletions which in itself is incredibly rare. Only three times in NFL history has a quarterback held a perfect passer rating in the playoffs and Manning is the only one since 1976 to do it. His Y/A was 14.5 which is the 6th highest ever in a playoff game during the Super Bowl era. His 18.35 ANY/Y+ is the highest ever in a playoff game during the Super Bowl Era (Fun Fact: Tebow vs. Steelers is the 2nd highest ANY/A+ at 16.95).  His TD% is the 5th highest of any quarterback in a game (19.2%) in the Super Bowl Era. This means he threw a TD basically once every 5 pass ATTEMPTS.

As stated previously, Peyton was finished with 5:24 left in the 3rd quarter. Had he kept his pace over a full 60 minutes he would have been 33/39 for 571 yards and 7.6 touchdowns.

Another thing to mention is the Broncos defense. While not elite, they were still very solid. 6th in passing yards allowed, 4th in total yards allowed, 9th in points allowed, and 12th by defensive DVOA. They only allowed 30+ points twice in the regular season: to HOF quarterbacks Tom Brady and Brett Favre. The Patriots and Packers scored 30 and 31 points respectively against the Broncos. Manning’s Colts accomplished that feat in the 1st half alone.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Brady vs. Falcons: Super Bowl 51**

With 8:31 left in the 3rd quarter the Falcons were up 28-3. A couple minutes later, the Falcons win probability peaked at 99.8%. Up to Super Bowl 51, teams were 4-1057 since 1991 when trailing by 25 points or more.  However, the Patriots were not just trailing by 25, they were trailing by 25 with less than a 3rd of the game to play. Up to that game and since 2001, teams down between 26 and 23 points with 6-9 min left in the 3Q were 0-190. If the Patriots were to win the most important game of the year, they would have had to be literally flawless from then on out.

After the Falcons went up 28-3, the Patriots scored on five consecutive drives converting 22/23 first downs and scoring four touchdowns and a field goal (The one first down in which they didn’t convert led to the field goal). During these five drives, Brady was 4/6 on 3rd down including 3/3 from 3rd and 8 or longer. On the two 3rd downs he didn’t convert, he converted one 4th down and the other was kicked for a field goal. If the Patriots didn’t convert anything less than a single 1st down (less than 22/23) they would have lost the game. From 8:31 to the end of the game, the Patriots were scoring at an insane pace. If the Patriots kept that pace over a 60-minute game, they would have scored 74 points.

For the entire game, Brady was 43/62 for 466 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT, and a 95.2 passer rating. However, the majority of those stats came during the comeback. From 8:31 left in the 3rd quarter to the end of the game, Tom Brady was 27/34 for 284 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT with a 122.7 Passer Rating. If this rate were to be applied over a full 60-minute game, Brady would have been 59/74 throwing for 620 yards and 4.4 touchdowns.

Last thing of note were Brady’s targets during the comeback: Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan, Danny Amendola, Malcolm Mitchell, Dion Lewis, Martellus Bennett, and James White. That’s two undrafted WR, a 7th round QB, a 5th round RB, a 4th round WR, a 4th round RB, and a 2nd round TE at the tail end of his career. Those seven players have combined for 0 Pro Bowls and 0 All Pro.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we’ve officially made it to the end. This process took over five weeks to complete. We went through all 32 draft slots and assembled the best possible teams, and then we put it to a vote where you guys determined the overall champion and which team deserved to be crowned the greatest draft pick team of all time.

**After yesterday’s championship game and 186 responses, the #4 Pick Team (68.8%) defeats the #2 Pick Team (31.1%) for the title.**

It’s not too surprising that the #4 pick team ended up winning it all. The quarterback is a Hall of Famer. The two halfbacks are Hall of Famers. The cast of receivers consists of three players who combined for 13 Pro Bowls, including one who could wind up being a Hall of Fame player when all is said and done in AJ Green. The offensive line has a combined 41 Pro Bowls between them, with each player on the line having made at least seven Pro Bowls.

Defensively, the #4 pick team is really good as well. The defensive line consists of three Hall of Fame players, including arguably the greatest defensive tackle of all-time in Mean Joe Greene. Every player on the defense has made it to at least one Pro Bowl. The linebackers have a combined 17 Pro Bowls between them, and are led by Derrick Thomas, who’s career ended far too soon. And the secondary has arguably the best safety of the 1980s (Kenny Easley), and arguably the best defensive back of the past 20 years in Charles Woodson. All in all, this team is loaded, and won every matchup it had in the postseason comfortably.

As for the tournament itself, the consensus seems to be that the further down you go, the worse the draft picks become, which is to be expected. The first round was incredibly chalk, with the higher seed winning 15 out of 16 games; the second round followed this pattern too, as six of the eight games were won by the highest seed.

So, what comes next? I’ve got another series idea in the works similar to this one that I’m working on right now and should propose to you by the end of the week. I may also look to expand this next year to include the second round draft picks; however, this is just spitballing at this point, as that’s a long ways away.

The support that this series received over this past month and a half has been incredible. To get so many votes on each of these posts, and to see so many people getting involved and posting in-depth descriptions of the teams is humbling. I can’t thank you guys enough for the success that this series has had, and hope that this was an enjoyable way for you to pass some time in the offseason. It was a blast to write these posts, as I learned quite a bit along the way about the history of the draft and the success of these picks.

If you want to look at the hub to see the complete results of the bracket, or look at the rosters of some of the teams in the tournament, it’s attached at the top. Otherwise, be on the lookout later this week for the start of a brand new series to get us through the final month of the offseason.",/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament: Series Finale,post

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

Season 35: 1954 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 26-December 26, 1954

Teams: 12

1954 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1954 First Draft Pick: Bobby Garrett, Quarterback from Stanford University (Cleveland Browns)

1954 NFL Championship Game: Cleveland Browns (9-3-0) defeated Detroit Lions (9-2-1) 56-10 at Cleveland Stadium in Cleveland, OH.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-Whenever it is raining, or whenever the field is wet and slippery, the offensive team can request a new, dry playable ball at any time.

In the Western Division, the 49ers pulled ahead in Week 5 (October 24) with a 37–31 win over the Lions, but they lost 4 of their remaining 7 games and finished 7–4–1. The Lions, on the other hand, lost only 1 game in their last 7, and finished 9–2–1. In the Eastern race, the Eagles got off to a 4–0 start, until dropping games to Pittsburgh (17–7) and Green Bay (37–14) to fall into a 3-way tie with the Giants and Steelers. The Browns, who got off to a 1–2 start, went on an 8-game winning streak, gradually catching up with a Halloween win over New York (24–14). A 6–0 win over Philadelphia on November 21 gave them the conference lead, and a 16–7 rematch win in New York the next week extended the margin. The Browns' streak was ended on December 19 with a 14–10 loss to the Lions in the final week of the regular season. However, both teams had qualified for the championship game, so it was more of an exhibition for the following week.

The 1954 NFL Championship featured a rarity, 2 teams meeting in a title game for the 3rd consecutive year. The Lions and Browns were accomplishing that very feat in 1954. The Lions won the previous two: 17–7 at Cleveland in 1952 and 17–16 at home in Briggs Stadium in 1953. They were attempting to become the first team to win 3 consecutive league titles in the championship game era (since 1933). The Browns, who entered the league only in 1950 with the demise of the All-America Football Conference, faced a particularly daunting task in taking on the Lions, having lost all 8 of the franchise's previous matches against the Detroit club.

The Lions were led by quarterback Bobby Layne, running back Doak Walker, and head coach Buddy Parker. The Browns were led by head coach Paul Brown and quarterback Otto Graham. The Lions had won the regular season meeting 14–10 the week before on December 19, also at Cleveland, with a late touchdown. Detroit was a slight favorite (2½ to 3 points) to three-peat as champions.

On its first possession, Lions' fullback Bill Bowman ran for 50 yards but lost the ball to Cleveland on a fumble. The Lions regained possession at the Cleveland 35 when Joe Schmidt intercepted an Otto Graham pass. The Browns defense held and Detroit was forced to settle for a 36-yard field goal by Doak Walker, making it 3-0.

Billy Reynolds returned the subsequent kickoff 46 yards, crossing midfield to the Lions' 41 yard line. Cleveland was forced to punt but a roughing penalty gave the Browns new life and Graham hit Ray Renfro with a 35-yard pass for a touchdown. Following the Lou Groza conversion, the score stood at Cleveland 7, Detroit 3.

On the next possession another Layne interception by defensive back Paul was run back 33 yards, setting up Cleveland in the red zone on the Detroit 8 yard line, with Graham hitting left end Darrell Brewster for the score. Following Groza's kick the score was Browns 14, Lions 3 after the 1st quarter.

In the 2nd quarter, Detroit was again stopped on their next possession and its punt was taken by Cleveland's Billy Reynolds and returned 46 yards to the Detroit 10 yard line. Grinding the ball to the 1 yard line, Graham ran a quarterback sneak and hit paydirt. Following the Groza conversion the score stood at Browns 21, Lions 3.

Lion running back Lewis Carpenter tore up a 52-yard run in Detroit's next possession, setting up Detroit for its only touchdown of the day when fullback Bill Bowman scored from five yards out. Following the conversion by Lions kicker Doak Walker, it was Browns 21, Lions 10.

Cleveland was forced to punt, but on the next Detroit possession defensive lineman McCormack ripped the ball from Layne, with the Browns recovering on the Detroit 31. Four plays later Graham ran for another touchdown, reaching the end zone standing up. With the conversion the score was Browns 28, Lions 10, and the route was on.

Yet another Bobby Layne pass was intercepted by Cleveland's Michaels, who was listed as a substitute fullback and was thus probably playing the modern equivalent of the safety position. With the ball on the Lions' 31, Otto Graham launched a pass to halfback Ray Renfro, who made a great catch at the five yard line and took the ball over the score. With Groza's conversion, the halftime score was Browns 35, Lions 10.

Coming out of the half, the Lions were down 25 points, needing anything to get back in the game. The Browns opened the second half with a six play drive, highlighted by a 43-yard strike from Otto Graham to Darrell Brewster, who was stopped just short of the goal line. Graham scored his third touchdown of the day with a quarterback sneak, with Groza converting to make the score Browns 42, Lions 10.

Kenny Konz grabbed the first of his two interceptions, running the ball back to the Detroit 13. Two plays later substitute fullback Curly Morrison scored on a 12-yard run. Following the Groza extra point, the 3rd quarter score stood at Browns 49, Lions 10.

The 4th quarter featured another pick by Konz set up the final touchdown of the day, when substitute halfback Chet Hanulak scored from the 10. With Groza's extra point, the final score was reached: Browns 56, Lions 10.

The 1954 Championship Game set many records, including a total of 13 turnovers (8 INTs, 5 fumbles). Despite the lopsided score, it was only the 2nd most lopsided title game to that point in NFL history, the record being a 73-0 shutout the Bears handed the Redskins in 1940.

This game would conclude a 3-year stretch of only seeing the Browns and Lions in title games, however it wouldn't be the last time these teams met for an NFL Championship. They would meet again in 1957.

|**Offensive DVOA Past Decade**|3rd|4th|5th|
|**Defensive DVOA**|25th|28th|30th|

Despite fielding three of the worst defenses in the NFL by DVOA, these three teams combined for a 41-7 record (.854) including a 23-1 record at home. By offensive DVOA, these are 3 of the top 20 offenses of all time. They are also 3 of the top 5 offensive teams in the past decade. Only the 2010 Patriots and 2018 Chiefs ranked better by offensive DVOA. These three offenses were some of the highest scoring offenses ever by points scored: Packers (4th), Saints (7th), Patriots (17th). It is also worth mentioning that the Saints set the NFL record for most offensive yards in a single season.

|**ANY/A**|9.39|8.23|8.25|
|**ANY/A+**|147|132|132|

These three offenses were spearheaded by the 3 greatest quarterbacks of the decade and 3 of the top 10 greatest quarterbacks of all time. With respect to most passing TD in a season all time, their seasons rank 6th (Brees), 7th (Rodgers), and 14th (Brady). With respect to most passing yards in a season, Brees (2nd) and Brady (3rd) are top 3 all time. By QBR, Rodgers (3rd) and Brees (6th) were both all time great. Additionally Aaron Rodgers set the single season passer rating mark and his ANY/A+ was 4th all time. Both Brees and Brady put up 132 ANY/A+ which were better than Brady's 2010 unanimous MVP season (128). Drew Brees' season is also 4th all time in Completion %.

Both the Packers and Patriots had average running back production but the Saints running backs were dominant. 2820 yards from scrimmage including 6.1 yards/Touch is insane. Three different rushers with 500 yard 5 TD seasons. Pro Bowlers Mark Ingram and Chris Ivory were the 3rd and 4th string running backs for the Saints in 2011.

All three teams had four receiving options with at least 500 yards 5 TD with the Saints having five such receivers.  The Packers were the most efficient by scoring the most TD among the three with the least amount of touches. All five receiving options listed for GB were very good receivers. It is worth noting Randall Cobb was the sixth option. The Saints featured all pro TE Graham, all reliable receiver Colston, and three very good supporting receivers in Moore, Meachum, and Henderson. This is in addition to their potent runningback attack. The Patriots featured perennial all pros Welker and Gronkowski as well as extremely reliable receiving options in Hernandez and Branch. Gronkowski and Hernandez put up the greatest season for a TE duo ever.","The Offensive Explosion of 2011: Packers, Saints, and Patriots",post

Written by a Titans fan.  

---------------------

Colts: 

Offense: Eric Ebron has very probably peaked this year. People are hyping him up as a top 10 TE when the truth is he pretty much got force fed by targets by Luck due to the fact that the Colts WR corps outside of TY Hilton is as dry as Indiana in the 1920s. Dont forget TDs numbers are notoriously fickle and that Ebron had more TDs this year than his 4 years in Detroit COMBINED. Outside of that, I have nothing bad to say about the Colts offense. 

Defense: First of all, last year, the Colts ranked 19th in sacks, and that was with career years from Autry and Margus Hunt, as well as an insane 7 sacks from Darius Leonard. I’d be flabbergasted if any of those guys manage to hit those numbers in the entire rest of their career. Indy has added some backup with Justin Houston and some of their players should improve, but even at best I can't picture the Colts pass rush being better than around league average, and I'm pretty sure their interior pass rush will be way worse.

As for their secondary, Hooker is a good young stud and Geathers is a pretty solid SS, but their corners are terrible. Im sorry, but is any team really scared of a CB trio of Rock Ya-Sin(Great name btw), Quincy Wilson, and uhm…..*Checks notes*....Kenny Moore? And that's if all the DBs stay healthy or don't regress, which is as likely as Luck shaving his neckbeard.  Seriously, look at the 2018 Colts schedule and name how many teams the Colts beat that had more than 1 decent WR/TE. 2, and that’s counting the Giants without OBJ. In 2019, the Colts face 8 (or nine if you include the Steelers).

Coaching: N/A

---------------------

Jaguars: This team has got to be the most overhyped team, I stg. 2 years ago, they had a defense that was one of the best in the decade, the BOAT playing like an actual good QB, and Fournette before he fully turned into Trent Richardson 2.0. With how Jags fans talk about that team, you’d think they went 14-2, but the truth was they only went 11-5. And that was in a division where the Colts didnt have Luck, the Texans started Tom Savage for 7 games, and the Titans were consistent only at playing inconsistently.

Offense: Their receiving corps is barren, and I’m sorry, Nick Foles is not a miracle worker. Don't forget, his career years came behind a top 3 OL in the league throwing to guys like Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor, and Zach Ertz. The Jags have neither of those things, yet Foles is somehow going to keep up his play behind an inferior OL throwing to MUCH inferior weapons? Sure. Oh, and Leonard Fournette is currently almost finished his transformation into Trent Richardson, so good luck counting on the Jags run game. 

Defense: Now, their defense is nowhere near the 2017 level, and now Telvin Smith is now gone for the season. I dont care how bad he was last year, the chances a 4th round FCS rookie that was on almost nobody’s radar pre-draft is going to be able to even replicate his impact is about as high as the chance that Roger Goodell doesn't get boo’d. And although their CBs are still good, the Jags safety corps is about as loaded as their WR corps. Who’s starting next to Ronnie Harrison? Will it even matter? Probably not. 

Coaching: Doug Marrone is an overrated coach who got lucky with a team that Jeff Fisher could've probably coached to the SB, and DeFilippo was garbage in Minnesota for a reason. 

------------------------------

Texans: First of all, I just want to point to the fact that the Texans STILL dont have a GM. Following the footsteps of an esteemed organization in the Washington Wizards, apparently. Now to the team….

Offense: Most fans know that last year the Texans OL let up 62 sacks to opposing defenses, their own version of Texas hospitality. Deshaun Watson was hit so many times that at one point in the season, he had to take a bus between games because the team was scared about the effect of air pressure on his lungs and ribs. Let me repeat that again for emphasis. WATSON WAS SO INJURED HE COULDN’T FLY. In order to protect their franchise QB from such a fate, the Texans decided this offseason to bolster their offensive line by signing Matt Kalil and drafting 2 FCS OTs…..wait a second, that can't be right. That's it? 62 sacks and all they did was add a garbage injured OT and two guys who need at minimum a year or two to get acclimated to the NFL? Not even any help on the interior? Welp, I hope you Texans fans are praying for Watson, because he will need it. By the way, their best TE right now has a career high of 311 yards in a season. 

Defense: The Texans front 7 is impressive, other than the fact that one huge part of it is currently skipping camps because he wants a new contract. Clowney certainly isn't worth what he’s demanding, but he’s still a top level EDGE in a league where pass rush is becoming more and more important. The Texans probably can't afford him because they need to keep space open for Watson’s eventual mega-deal, but if he decides to sit out games to keep his body healthy, who’s going to replace his production? A burned out Whitney Mercilus? Duke Ejiofor? Joel Heath? Markell Reed? Ira Savage-Lewis??? I even made up a name and 99% of you guys probably didn't even notice. 

As for the secondary, the Texans managed to combine the worst parts of the Jags and Colts issues. Their CBs are bad and their safety corps is weak. Justin Reid might be a steal, but Gipson is pretty much another JAG at this point, and he’s arguably their second best DB. Roby’s not good anymore, Colvin’s meh at best, and the rest of the Texans CB corps gives me flashbacks to the 2016 Titans DBs, which is not a good thing. With a schedule that at worst 8 teams with more than 1 good WR/TE, the Texans defense is looking like Texas brisket. 

Coaching: BOB has managed to get more than 10 wins exactly once in a division that featured 2 bottom feeders and a team that once consisted of Andrew Luck, TY Hilton and trash cans. Some of the most talented rosters in the league, and what has that gotten Houston? A second round exit at best. Even the Titans matched that. Why exactly is he considered a decent coach again?

--------------------


Titans: Here’s a harsh truth for Titans fans, this is the last year of their title hopes. In the next two years, they will need to give huge paydays to Kevin Byard, one of Conklin/Kelly, Ben Jones, Derrick Henry, Jayon Brown and Delanie Walker. That's not including Mariota if he plays like a franchise QB. If he doesn't, how long till the Titans get someone who actually can? How long till the Titans get someone who’s better than Mariota, honestly? Somehow, he’s the best QB Tennessee has had this decade, forcing Titans fans to defend a guy who’s play has been pretty terrible in reality. How many prime years will the Titans waste till they can get someone who can bring them to the playoffs again? 


Offense: Fortunately, for this very last push, against teams with QBs like Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Patrick Mahomes etc, Tennessee fans get to cheer for the duo of Mariota and Tannehill, the two guys who would dominate the “about to break out award.” Maybe if they were mashed together, it would create an actual franchise QB who could play a full season without injuries. Availability is part of being a franchise QB too, guys. 

Ignoring the burning QB question, the rest of the offense is full of problems as well. Derrick Henry might have hit 1k yards, but he can't play the Jags every game, and how many more slow starts can the Titans stomach? The offensive line should be solid on the left, but the right side is a far cry from the 2017 levels. Jack Conklin was a shadow of himself last year due to his ACL tear, Dennis Kelly is a career backup who managed 1 good string of games, and whoever starts at RG will at best have a total of 1 career start. Delanie Walker is also coming off a brutal ankle injury. He might look good in training camp, but when’s the last time a player came off an injury like that and wasn’t at least rusty? Don't forget he’s 34 now too. Lastly, Corey Davis is probably the most overrated “underrated” WR in the league. Yeah, he almost hit 900 yards on an offense with 0 other receiving weapons that was forced to start Blaine Gabbert, but that almost meant he pretty much got forcefed on passing downs. Out of all WRs who had more than 100 targets, his catch % ranked 5th to the bottom, only above Jarvis Landry, Zay Jones, Michael Crabtree, and Kenny Golloday. Can Davis be a solid low end WR1 in the future? Sure, but he’s not going to be able to make magic out of a garbage offense like Hopkins or OBJ could. 

Defense the Titans have a huge problem on their DL. Casey is a stud, Wake still has some juice left, and Landry showed flashes, but who else is providing pass rush? I dont see a single player on the DL who would hit 5+ sacks barring a huge breakout. When your second and third leading pass rushers are ILBs, something needs to be fixed. 

Coaching: This is roughly the 5th OC the Titans have had so far. How are they supposed to create a function offense when the offensive coordinator changes constantly? That’s like building a skyscraper, but the architect’s swap out constantly. Good luck fielding an offense that, let's be realistic here, isn't in the bottom 5.

On paper, Todd Gurley had a phenomenal season, accounting for 21 total TDs and over 1800+ all purpose yards. All of this done on excellent efficiency with 4.9 YPC. However, for better or worse, these stats don’t tell the whole story on Gurley’s season. Due to a lingering knee issue, his play at the end of the year tailed off, and could not play in the Rams last two games. This is around the time CJ Anderson started to shine, and many people believed that Gurley’s production was a product of the players around him, specifically offensive line. 

While Gurley may not be the absolute best pure runner in the NFL, he still has the vision and the cuts to find the holes he needs both at the first and second level. [(First run vs. Denver.)](https://youtu.be/XugXFkY3vqM)
Even with his 6’1 220+ frame and a knee injury that lingered throughout the season, [he still managed to make some defenses look silly with his speed bouncing to the outside.](https://youtu.be/XugXFkY3vqM?t=128)
He used that big frame to get to 17 rushing TDs total, many of which were within 5 yards.
What really makes Gurley so valuable to the Rams though is that he is a complete back, capable of taking on all sorts of rushers in pass protection, and being a very solid and aware pass-catcher. [He does quite a bit of damage on screens](https://youtu.be/atq0Jf5EewY?t=115), and was targeted often. 
It’s because he’s the quintessential complete back that he’s ranked where he is and garners the respect he does. 

Unfortunately, this is likely the last we’ll see Gurley get over 1800 all purpose yards, as his knee arthritis condition will limit his touches and prevent him from being the every-down back he was before. That being said, he’ll still definitely stay a major offensive threat due to this versatility whenever he is on the field.

Demarcus Lawrence is a bully. He will take your mother out to a nice candlelit dinner and never call her again. He doesn't need to steal your lunch money because he already has it. He stole it from your Dad before he even gave it to you. I say all this to give you a visual representation of a man who will absolutely [fuck you up](https://twitter.com/WillBrinson/status/1081743150039949313). Look at that. I'm pretty sure Ifedi's heart just decided to stop beating after a blow like that. Or maybe he just decided it was time to hang up the cleats. How does one even come back from that?

I don't want to get bogged down in PFF stats and other cool stuff in the numbers when talking about D-Law because, truth be told, he's a highlight machine. If you are unlucky enough to play RT for a team going against the Cowboys you should already know that you won't remember the next day. But, you see, the Eagles didn't seem to understand this. They chose to *run the option* against him! [This is what happens when you try to run the option against Demarcus Lawrence](https://i.imgur.com/q5ZGdD7.gifv). 

Now, what did we learn Carson? ...Carson? Are you okay?

""....What day is it?""

Demarcus Lawrence consistently pressures the quarterback, the running back, and just about anyone you decide to put in the backfield. [He has enough nuance in his arm and hip motion to blow past massive offensive linemen](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1064658929928548354?s=19), but he almost ever uses it because [he prefers to make you look like an absolute buffoon on national television](https://twitter.com/VeteranScout/status/1044386871919357953?s=19). All in all, you gameplan for D-Law or he ruins your day. Simple as that. Very few players have the ability to find the ball as consistently as he does, and he does it while hauling a 300-pound lineman.

#\#28 – Zach Ertz – Tight End – Philadelphia Eagles [](/PHI)

**Written By:** */u/wrhslax1996** [](/PHI)  
  
I'm going to let y'all in on a little secret. Zach Ertz is a good Tight End. To start, let's get the boring statistics out of the way.

Zach Ertz finished 2019 with 154 targets, 116 catches (which set the NFL TE single-season reception record), 1163 yards (a personal best by more than 300 yards), 8 TDs, 2.04 yards per route run, and he looked much improved as a blocker. He accounted for 26% of all Eagles targets on the year, 27.5% of all Eagles receptions, and 27.6% of the Eagles receiving TDs. He was obscenely good last season statistically and was, in my opinion, one of the best receivers in the NFL last season. Watching every game, it was almost like every time the ball went to him I expected a first down which is not a feeling most teams have the luxury of knowing.

A common narrative I've seen on r/nfl and on various talkshows is that Wentz spent the whole season checking the ball down to Ertz. After all, how do you get that many receptions in a season? Well, I'll show you why he was (and should have been) Wentz's favorite target.

First, Ertz is [phenomenal at the catch point](https://twitter.com/BR_NFL/status/1056576666254884864). This play is obscenely good, in my opinion. The coverage isn't bad on a good route, but Ertz goes up and attacks the ball and does not allow himself to be outmuscled by a defender in good position to make a play on the ball. This aggression at the point of the catch is something Eagles fans are all well aware of and you'll see that in a lot of the following clips. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp_Pf2MWAG8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33) is linked to take you to a similar catch by Ertz against the Vikings last season. I recommend watching the whole video, but at least watch the route/catch at 0:33. It is extremely difficult to defend Ertz when the ball is in the air because he's that good at putting himself in a good, strong position to make the catch.

Second, his [route running](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/1046873465213607937) [is](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/1067193455196233728) [so](https://twitter.com/TSteegeNFL/status/1050840516533743617) [good](https://twitter.com/MattBowen41/status/1071812991803383809). The first clip posted by Fran Duffy exhibits how good Ertz is at finding the soft spot in a zone, settling in, and getting an easy 10-20 yards. Ertz won't wow anybody with his open-field speed, but he has the football IQ and awareness to exploit the soft spots in a zone defense and capitalize. The second clip posted by Duffy is also impressive. The giants send a man across the field following Golden Tate to bluff man-coverage. After the ball is snapped, however, the Giants immediately go to a Cover 2 Zone defense. Great job by Wentz on the read, but Ertz runs a great route, finds the hole, catches the ball, and fights his way through four defenders into the end zone. The 3rd clip above (posted by Tyler Steege) displays Ertz's pure route running ability. He's matched up with CB Janoris Jenkins and Ertz manages to completely turn him around en route to catching a TD pass from Carson Wentz. What Ertz lacks in speed he more than makes up for in his ability to sell great routes and get defenses turned around. The fourth clip above, posted by Matt Bowen, is just more of the same impressive route-running. Ertz uses his body to bait DBs into getting out of position, thus getting him more separation and allowing for an easier catch. Ertz's route-running and football acumen make him a bona fide mismatch for any defense.

Third, I'd like to provide two more clips. [This one](https://twitter.com/J_Sammour/status/1082299935863779328) exhibits that Ertz is not a completely helpless blocker. I won't claim he's on the level of Kittle as a blocker because that would just not be true, but when he puts in good effort, Ertz can block. He was much improved as a blocker last season. [This clip](https://twitter.com/BR_NFL/status/1076940552787111937) should hopefully put to rest the ZaCh ErTz CaNt GeT YaC crowd. I won't claim he's elite after the catch, but he can bump and grind his way down to the end zone when he needs to/has the space. God I love Zach Ertz.

Also, I feel like I can't really capture the entire story of his 2018 season without providing [this clip](https://twitter.com/247KevinBoilard/status/1054061464724627458) of Ertz getting laid out by Eric Reid. I learned two things from this clip. 1) Ertz loves his QB and will defend Wentz's honor to the grave. 2) Ertz should probably stick to catching the football instead of getting into fights on the field.

I hope this was informative. I love talking about Zach Ertz and I hope you learned something about his 2019. He was really good and earned a high position on this years top 100.

The Jaguars have had a lot of free agent signings over the past decade that didn’t go to plan. Julius Thomas, Aaron Ross, Laurent Robinson… there have been a lot of free agents that went off script. But Calais Campbell is not one of them. In fact, he is making a case for the greatest defensive free agent signing in franchise history after just two seasons.

Campbell followed up an incredible 2017 season, where he was a First Team All Pro and a Pro Bowler, by picking up right where he left off. He started all 16 games for the Jaguars, recorded 10.5 sacks, a career-high 72 tackles, and 20 tackles for a loss, which was the third best total in the league last year. Consider this:

- Campbell is the only Jaguar ever to have back-to-back seasons of 10+ sacks; he had 14.5 sacks in 2017, and 10.5 sacks in 2018.

- Campbell’s 20 tackles for a loss set the franchise record for most TFLs in a single season. In fact, it completely destroyed the record; the previous record, held by Sen’Derrick Marks in 2014 and Gary Walker in 2001, was 15. Campbell eclipsed that mark by 33%.

- Over the final month of the season, Campbell recorded 4.5 sacks, had eight tackles for a loss, and recorded 10 quarterback hits.

Campbell has been one of the best defensive line players in the NFL for quite some time now, and the 2018 season was no exception.

Going into the 2018 off-season, numerous writers and analysts throughout the football universe had pegged the Indianapolis Colts as one of the top (bottom?) candidates in terms of lack of top-flite talent, particularly on the defensive end. The secondary was a mish-mash of undrafted overachievers and unproven talent, while the front seven had no star power of which to speak.

Enter Darius Leonard. 

Initially labeled as [one of the worst picks of the draft] (https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2773118-nfl-draft-2018-results-reviewing-this-years-worst-picks.amp.html), Leonard went from camp sensation to exploding onto the scene with 19 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble, AND a pass defended [in his second career game](https://youtu.be/Qej3TmbDoH4). ""The Maniac"" would rampage though his rookie season, leading the entire league in tackles with 163, finishing second among rookies with 7 sacks, while chipping in 4 forced fumbles, 2 interceptions, and 8 passes defended. For his efforts, he was named a first-team All-Pro and Defensive Rookie of the Year.

Leonard gained a knack for making huge plays in the clutch, such as his [game-sealing forced fumble](https://youtu.be/5SKH2K-Df_k) against Oakland, or his [excellent coverage to force a last-minute interception](https://www.colts.com/video/malik-hooker-picks-off-eli-to-seal-colts-comeback-win) against the Giants. Despite questions about his coverage skills, Leonard showed constant improvement throughout the year, using his speed to come up with clutch deflections, even when he was tasked with lining up against players like DeAndre Hopkins one-on-one in the red zone.

Colts fans could not be more excited about the future for Leonard. He is already the best defensive player Indianapolis has had since at least Robert Mathis. It will be tough to clear the bar Leonard set as a rookie, but his work ethic and versatile skill set will help him improved throughout his career.

He is rarely found in the conversation with the NFL's most accurate quarterbacks but there aren't many other quarterbacks that can consistently hit receivers that are [consistently not open](https://streamable.com/n73ob).

What do you think of when you think of a superstar receiver? Probably a physical freak of nature that has the size and the speed. Most of the time, you’re right, but there are exceptions to every rule. Tyreek Hill is one of them. He beats you in different ways and he still just as good as those other elites at producing for his team. In some ways, he’s even better. Let’s find out how. 

First, let’s go ahead and break this stereotype up right now. He can make those contested catches too. Just as good as those other elites. [In fact, he’s even better](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-ranking-the-nfls-top-receivers-in-contested-catch-situations). If you need to see it in action, [just ask the 49ers](https://imgur.com/a/aXGlKKo). 

Many of you probably value yards per route run when judging a wide receiver. It’s a top efficiency metric available for us to easily see. Hill’s is 2.54. This is behind only Julio Jones and Michael Thomas among qualifying wide receivers. 3rd behind those two isn’t too shabby.

Now to the volume statistic correspondent there. Total receiving yards. 1,479 is his total here. This ranks him 4th in the NFL. This is behind Jones, Hopkins, and Evans, whose totals are 1,677, 1,572, and 1,524 respectively. Pretty solid right? Well, it’s about to get a little more impressive. Going through the situational statistics on NFL’s website and calculating the number of yards each receiver accumulated in which their team was losing by 17 or more is how. Julio’s was 222, Hopkins was at 46, and Evans came in at 135. What was Hill at? 0. If you were to take these off their totals, Hill will obviously stay at 1,479. Julio drops to 1,455, Hopkins drops to 1,526, and Evans down to 1,389. With Hill not losing any yardage here off his total, he’s now second in the NFL, behind Hopkins. It’s not fair to take those yards away from them by any means. They still made the plays and there were no doubt times there where the game was still in reach. It’s still a great way to add a little context to their numbers, and you can make of those what you wish.

Let’s move onto his bread and butter. Deep yards. In case you weren’t sure what this statistic actually is, it means that the pass traveled 20 yards past the line of scrimmage before being caught by the WR. You are probably expecting Hill to be good here. And you’re right. He is. No wait. You’re wrong. He was great. Outstanding. By far the best in the NFL. His yards accumulated here ranked him 1st in the NFL, and not just by a little bit. Hill had 754 deep yards in 2018. Second place was Evans with 543. I’ll do the math for you. That’s 211 yards ahead of 2nd place in the NFL. To add a little context to that, if we go through the 2nd-10th place guys, the biggest gap from one position to the next is 75 yards, and that’s the gap from 6th place Julio at 464 and 7th place Adams at 389. The next biggest is 34 yards, the distance between Lockett in 4th, coming in at 520, and Antonio Brown in 5th at 486. That’s an insane amount of distance he’s ahead of 2nd place when we look at how much everyone else is bunched up. I don’t need to tell you the significance of this statistic. Everyone here knows how much that opens up the field for other guys like Kelce and how it massively helps the screen game that Reid loves to run.

Now I know what you’re thinking. He had the top QB of 2018 throwing him the ball in Mahomes. Fair point. Well, to that I say, in 2017 with Smith at the helm, he had a QB rating when targeted of 130.5 and 628 deep yards, and those were both tops in the league. Those 628 deep yards would also place him 2nd in 2018, behind only himself. Granted Smith was a top five QB of 2017, but he was also someone who, until 2017, was thought of as someone who doesn’t throw deep a ton. And Smith last season I’d certainly argue was not a ton better passing the ball than many of the other QBs that WRs here on this list in 2018 I’m comparing Hill to with these statistics had. 2017 obviously doesn’t factor into our rankings, but it does provide the context needed for that specific argument, which is an inevitable one.

How about YAC? Yeah, you guessed it, he’s pretty awesome here too. 524 was his 2018 total, good for 2nd in the NFL among WRs. The Chargers in week 1 found out about this very early on. [Here we see him blow by the edge guy and get 10 yards down field before the defense even knows what hit em](https://imgur.com/a/UlGrk4a). And if that wasn’t enough for them, [he took one to the house later on in the game](https://imgur.com/a/piHiacw). Then there were just the little things he did all season that were imperative to the team. Against a top edge guy in T.J. Watt, [he avoids him and turns a 5 yard loss into a 5 yard gain](https://imgur.com/a/UNTAxyH). The difference between 2nd and 5 and 2nd and 15 is massive. Watt did everything perfect here and makes that play against possibly every player in the league except Hill.

Just to touch on a few intangibles, he was first in the NFL among WRs in all purpose yards. Special teams contributions did not factor into our rankings, but it does once again provide a little context. Had he not done the punt return stuff (which he was amazing at), then it’s fair to say he’d have accumulated a few more offensive yards. Rushing yards? 151 of those, good for 2nd among traditional wide receivers. That was something implemented periodically in the Chiefs offense, and it [often worked to perfection](https://imgur.com/a/EqyASRf).

It’s clear. He’s elite. He’s one of the very best in the NFL at the wide receiver position. He’s THE best at the deep game and, per PFF, was the best in 2018 in contested catches as well. He’s not a gadget player. He’s not a secret weapon. Hill is imperative to the success of the Chiefs offense. I would say he’s not a guy you play tight man to man coverage on with no safety help, [but the Raiders decided to try to anyway](https://imgur.com/a/mOUCt2v). For his tremendous efforts, consistency, and elite play at the wide receiver position, Hill lands at spot number 24 on our list.

Patrick Peterson proved again why he is considered the model for prospective NFL shutdown corners. His athletic prowess and undeniably effective man coverage technique and talent was on full display in 2018. Despite the Cardinals turn for the worse, Peterson without question took his game to another level.

Although unaccustomed to such a large percentage of his snaps being zone coverage, Peterson took to them quickly and added a new wrinkle for quarterbacks to deal with when targeting him. He was quick to identify routes, jumped them without leaving his responsibilities and for the most part shutdown whatever side of the field he was on.

Peterson’s man coverage capabilities were given more exposure down the stretch as Wilks shifted his defensive philosophy back towards more of what it was under James Bettcher and Todd Bowles. We saw Peterson play more press man coverage and receiver targets in his vicinity took a dramatic drop.

Overall Peterson’s coverage netted him one of the lowest target percentages on coverage snaps. Only 9% of all quarterback throws went his way, he gave up an extremely low .63 yards per coverage snap, and he only allowed 30 receptions for 364 yards on 52 targets. Peterson locked down his side of the field with authority.

Although this upcoming year Peterson will be sitting out for the first 6 games of the season due to a PED suspension we should expect the 8 time Pro Bowler and 4 time 1st Team All-Pro corner to return to form immediately.

Christian McCaffrey did just about everything for the Panthers this year, playing one of the most versatile roles in the entire league. From breaking an NFL record, 107 catches at the RB position to averaging 5.0 yards per carry, it's no shock to see him at 2nd team All Pro despite the extremely tough competition at running back. McCaffrey was on the field for over 90% of snaps, easily the most at his position, and filled up the box score with 1900+ all purpose yards.  
  
Dealing with some unfortunate injury luck with both starting tackles (Matt Kalil and Daryl Williams) missing the entire season, McCaffrey, along with Norv Turner, exceeded well beyond expectations. Often times the entire defense would zero in on McCaffrey [opening plays up for others players such as CJ Anderson](https://streamable.com/3qpam). Everyone looks out for the potential McCaffrey screen and it results in an easy TD for CJ. There was no shortage of highlight plays either with [this hurdle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raq4Od7-n48) making it's way on to a few television screens along with his 63 broken tackles, second to only Saquon Barkley in that measure. In short, with Cam Newton's arm giving out mid season, our offense essentially evolved around our RB and he delivered every week, easily deserving of a top 25 spot

#\#21 – David Bakhtiari – Offensive Tackle – Green Bay Packers [](/GB)

**Written By:** */u/eurasianlynx* [](/GB)   
  
David Bakhtiari has been the best pass-blocking left tackle since Joe Thomas retired.

Now, I know whenever you put any tackle's name in the same sentence as a legendary figure like Thomas, you immediately lose some credibility, so let me explain.

It all starts with the stance; Bakhtiari has [that classic James Campen-taught stance](https://imgur.com/arWhyWZ.png) with the droopy back leg and the right arm keeping him hunched over his knee. There's really nothing like it elsewhere in the NFL--the other other guy who kept his leg so far back and his body so hunched over was [Thomas](http://cdn.insidethepylon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/joe-thomas-still-1-218x300.png).

Again, whenever you start drawing comparisons to the greatest of all time, things get a little murky. If there was ever something to criticize about Joe, it was his stance. It's supposed to hurt your balance, mobility, and power. It limits your ability to react to a pass rusher. If any other tackle in the league tried to copy Joe Thomas' stance, they would fail. Only Joe can use his stance, because he is the exception to every rule.

Bakhtiari has become the exception.

Now, his standalone pass-block stats tell the story of just a good tackle, not the dominant force he truly is--he ranks 6th in hurries allowed, 7th in QB hits allowed, 12th in sacks allowed (all per pass block snap), and his pass-blocking efficiency of 97.9 is just 7th among tackles. However, it's the way he allowed pressures that made him a first-team All-Pro for the first time. 

From PFF:

&gt; Another thing that makes him so special is his how infrequently he loses cleanly. We separate our downgrades for offensive linemen in pass protection into three buckets based on how quickly and cleanly they lose. Bakhtiari was one of six starting tackles this season to not have a single pass blocking rep that earned the worst downgrade – and he did it on the third-most pass-blocking snaps of any tackle in the NFL (737). Among full-time starters this season, Bakhtiari had the fourth-fewest amount of pass-blocking snaps that earned the second-lowest downgrade as well (10). His consistency and relatively mild losses are a big reason why Aaron Rodgers is capable of making so many second reaction plays whether it’s inside or outside the pocket.

Considering Rodgers' average time to throw last season was 2.95 seconds, good for 5th highest in the league, and he held on to the ball for over 3 seconds on 30% of his dropbacks, the fact that Bakhtiari can maintain such a high level of production is absurd--but that's just the price of being the protective brother your quarterback never had.

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

For me I have 2 that come to mind. Last year the Seahawks were thought to be terrible and everyone thought the legion of boom was finished. They shocked the world and made the playoffs. 

Also the 2017 jets. That team was really bad. Everyone was making parallels to the 2016 browns and saying they would go 0-16. They started the season 3-2 and lost a lot of games by choking or weird stuff happening. For example they lost week 6 to the patriots because a touchdown was called back and the patriots got the ball which shifted the entire games momentum. Jets win if that doesn’t happen and go 4-2. They then lose a game to the dolphins because the dolphins came back. If the jets don’t choke they’re 5-2. Then they choke to the falcons the week after that. See a pattern? Considering how terrible that roster was they outplayed every expectation they had by playing well (for the first 3 quarters atleast)",What’s a team that was supposed to do really bad but outplayed their expectations?,post

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 34: 1953 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 27-December 13, 1953

Teams: 12

1953 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1953 First Draft Pick: Harry Babcock, End from the University of Georgia (San Francisco 49ers)

1953 NFL Championship Game: Detroit Lions (10-2-0) defeated Cleveland Browns (11-1-0) 17-16 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, MI.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The definition of illegal motion is clarified. A player must be moving directly forward at the snap to be considered illegally in motion.

Prior to the season, the American and National Conferences (which had been used for the prior 3 seasons) reverted back to the Eastern and Western Conferences used before. Meanwhile, a Baltimore, Maryland group headed by Carroll Rosenbloom was granted an NFL team, and was awarded the holdings of the defunct Dallas Texans organization. The new team was named the Baltimore Colts, after the previous team of the same name that folded after the 1950 season. The 12 teams of this NFL season continued for the rest of the 1950s; these teams became known as ""old-line"" teams as they predated the 1960 launch of the American Football Leage, also known as the AFL.

The Western race saw the Rams beat the Lions twice, in Detroit (October 18) and in L.A. (November 1), and at the midway point in Week 6, the Rams were a full game ahead in the race. In Week 7 (November 8), the 49ers beat the Rams 31–27, and the Lions won their game, to put all three teams at 5–2–0. In Week 8, the Lions beat Green Bay 14–7, while the Rams were tied 24–24 by the Cardinals, and the 49ers lost 23–21 to the Browns. As both teams won their remaining games, San Francisco was always a game behind Detroit, meaning for the 2nd year in a row, the Lions were going to the NFL Championship Game.

In the Eastern race, the Cleveland Browns won their first 11 games and led wire-to-wire, clinching a playoff spot by week 10. They were the only team in their conference to start 2-0-0, which saw them never not in the lead during the season. Their shot at a 12–0–0 regular season was spoiled by a 42–27 loss in the finale on December 13. They would however advance to the NFL Championship Game for the 4th year in a row, and their 8th Championship Game in a row if we count their previous 4 years in the AAFC.

The 1953 NFL Championship Game was the 2nd of 3 consecutive title games between the Detroit Lions and Cleveland Browns. The defending champion Lions were led by quarterback Bobby Layne and running back Doak Walker, and the Browns  were led by head coach Paul Brown and quarterback Otto Graham. The Browns came into the game favored by 3 points.

The game opened up with a Doak Walker 1-yard touchdown run to put the Lions up 7-0. In the 2nd quarter, both teams would exchange field goals as both Lou Groza of Cleveland and Walker of Detroit put the ball through the uprights. This would lead to a 10-3 Lions lead at the half. In the 2nd half, the Browns appeared to start taking over the game, as in the 3rd quarter, they tied it with a Chick Jagade 9-yard touchdown run. Then in the 4th quarter, the Browns got their first lead with 2 field goals from Groza to make it 16-10. With 4:10 of play remaining, the Lions started from their own 20-yard line and fought their way 80 yards in 8 plays, the touchdown coming on a 33-yard pass from Bobby Layne to Jim Doran in the end zone, and Walker's extra point gave the Lions the lead. Trailing 17–16, the Browns had one last chance; Ken Carpenter started the drive with a run to his own 28, but an Otto Graham pass intended for Pete Brewster was deflected by rookie defensive halfback Carl Karilivacz, intercepting the throw, clinching the Lions their 3rd title.

These teams would return to the 1954 NFL Championship Game in another rematch, this being the 3rd in a row, a feat never accomplished before and hasn't been accomplished since.

&gt; This season, the Broncos’ pass-rushing duo appears poised for a dominant showing — one perhaps reminiscent of the Miller-DeMarcus Ware days. One that may make Miller’s goal of topping Bruce Smith’s all-time sack record (200) seem like less of a pipe dream and more of an intriguing possibility. Maybe a little.

&gt; **“It’s just one of my lofty goals that I have for my career,” said Miller, who has 98 sacks. “The goal this year is just to hit that 20-sack mark. If I can get that, it’ll put me way ahead of the pace.”**

&gt; The hiring of defensive guru Vic Fangio as head coach has restored hope to a franchise that had lost its way in recent years and cast a spotlight on a position that has long been his specialty: the linebackers.

Miller is currently at 98 sacks. If he gets 20 sacks, he'd be at 118 sacks, which would put him 22nd in NFL history after nine seasons. Through nine seasons, Bruce Smith (the current leader with 200 sacks) had 106 sacks; Smith played 19 seasons in the NFL.","Broncos LB Von Miller on potentially breaking the all-time sacks record: “It’s just one of my lofty goals that I have for my career.

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

I'm a relatively new NFL fan as I'm not from the USA but as I've been getting more and more into football I've been seeing players and thinking ""he's clearly on steroids"" but then not being able to find anyone else saying the same thing.

This is very strange to me given the fact that calling out so called ""fake natty's"" is such a popular thing to do on the internet yet nobody is saying anything about clear steroid use in the NFL. Anybody who trains and knows anything about bodybuilding would be able to see that these guys aren't natural.

Much like the Jonathan Simmons story (NBA player who paid $150 just to have a tryout), Butler had to dish out his own cash to play in a random league just to continue to play football. The gamble seems to have paid off. Relevant part listed here:

&gt; The poster boy for The Spring League had some early doubts. 

&gt; Paul Butler actually thought he might have been scammed. 

&gt; Butler, now a tight end with the Raiders, was playing for Team West in The Spring League in Austin, Texas, just a year ago. But when he first signed up for the developmental league — and paid his $800 registration fee and bought his airline ticket — the silence was deafening. 

&gt; Then, the rosters for the four teams were announced. He kept scanning for his name Butler, Butler, Butler … Nope. 

&gt; “I was freaking out,” Butler said. “Getting really nervous. Like maybe I had been ripped off. I paid, they didn’t put me on a roster and they weren’t answering any of my e-mails or anything … What’s going on?”

&gt; But it was just a logistical mistake, and Butler finally got in touch with league founder Brian Woods.","One year ago, Raiders TE Paul Butler paid $800 to play professional football in The Spring League",post

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Saints|Raiders|Jets|~~Falcons~~|

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone.

Welcome to the third and final chapter of my series following Red Grange and the Chicago Bears' barnstorming tour through America!

Last time, we covered the first leg of the tour that wrapped up the NFL season and took on other teams in the Midwest and East Coast.  Today, we wrap up the tour with the second leg through Florida and the West Coast!

***

#Part 3: The January Tour

##The Florida League

Remember Tim Callahan's Florida league and C.C. Pyle's West Coast tour?  Eight days after the first tour ended, Grange traveled south to participate, but he wasn't alone for the Bears were joining him on his excursion spanning 7,000 miles.^[1][2]

Before leaving, Grange went home to Wheaton to heal his arm and visit his family.  ""For the first 
time in my life I had money and got a big kick out of being able to afford certain luxuries for my family,"" said Grange in his autobiography.^[1]  ""For Christmas I bought a roadster for Garland and presented Dad with a check for one thousand dollars.""

Grange's contract for the Florida games stipulated he would start and play the entire game if possible, with an exception being if he was seriously injured.^[3]  Speaking of injuries, he and Dr. E.B. Cooley expressed concern over his arm and potential complications after taking X-rays, but with the first game of the tour not being until Christmas Day, he had time to heal.^[4]  After giving further treatment and his patient assuring the media he would not be ""taking any chances with (his) injured wing"", Cooley cleared Grange to play.^[5][6]

The Bears' roster, which had 18 players for the first tour, featured some changes as they prepared to head to Florida.  Now at 21 players, quarterback Richard Vick, halfback Harold Erickson, end Paul Goebel, tackle Roy Lyman, and center Ralph Claypool joined the team; Vick was a member of the Detroit Panthers, whom the Bears had played earlier in December, while Erickson and Claypool came over from the Chicago Cardinals.  Goebel was an All-American at Michigan.^[1]

Grange and the Bears left for Florida on December 21.^[5][6]  This time, Pyle came prepared; he organized a special Pullman train car called ""Bethulla"" for the team, hired a personal porter for their luggage, and provided matching sweaters and pants.  On the ride between cities, the players gave the train the nickname ""Dog House"", a name they honored by barking.^[2]  Although the Bears continued their trend of playing on consecutive days, they explained it would not be an issue provided they had week-long breaks between such stretches.^[7]

##Game On

The Bears' train arrived in Miami on Wednesday afternoon, December 23.  Later that day, the team was treated to a banquet at a Coral Gables country club, attended by 200 Illinois students and faculty.  After a night of speeches and dancing, Grange and company got to work with practice the following day.^[8]

Christmas Day marked the first matchup of the Florida tour, the [Bears taking on a team of former college all-stars led by Callahan in Coral Gables](https://i.imgur.com/iiyB8Vs.jpg).  When they arrived in town, Halas, Pyle, and Bears co-owner Dutch Sternaman noticed the venue for the game was simply a large field of sand; to their astonishment, a 200-man team of carpenters showed up and quickly started building a temporary 25,000-seat stadium.^[1][2]  However, the field was a disaster, prompting Halas to call New York for new cleats, including a hard toe shoe for fullback/kicker Earl Britton.  Britton complained the hard toe wouldn't help him punt, and although he had two 50-yard punts in the game, he eventually switched to his usual shoes.^[2]  In the second quarter, Grange scored the game's lone touchdown on a two-yard run that had been set up by his 33-yard dash.  Grange played all but one quarter (third) in the 7–0 win, recording nine carries for 89 yards.^[9]  Although the game's promoter expressed excitement at possibly making a lot of money from it, only 8,000 tickets were sold as tickets went for $20 ($292.68 in 2019), over five times more expensive than for an NFL game.^[2]  The stadium was demolished the next day.^[1]

In other news that tied into a discussion in Part 2, the NCAA and American Football Coaches Association hosted their annual meeting in New York over the weekend, during which they condemned pro football for taking college football's stars like Grange and the Cardinals' Ernie Nevers away.^[10]  The Big Ten Conference, whom Grange's Illinois was a member of, had already prohibited pro players from accepting coaching jobs in the conference.  The AFCA also voted to prevent anyone affiliated with pro football from picking college all-star and All-American rosters, assuming those on such teams would eventually go pro.^[2]

Others proposed going as far as to ban or restrict pro football figures from getting close to college games.  But then again, as the Associated Press wrote, the forward pass had been torn apart by critics at the previous year's meeting, yet many ""agreed that the pass had made football a better game.""^[11]

In the media, some were especially and directly hostile to Grange as they attacked pro football.  In January 1926, Herbert Reed of *The Outlook* magazine used his name as a verb in his article ""De-Granging Football"": to ""grange"" a game means to exploit it.  Reed also called him ""rather pathetic"" and supported ostracizing college referees should they officiate a pro game.  He added he knew of ""hundreds"" of companies that had banned pro players from working for them, and even proclaimed the next generation of football players had been ""inoculated against professionalism in sport"" and would never follow Grange's footsteps.^[2]

The next game was not until New Year's Day in Tampa.  In the meantime, Callahan – whose team was scheduled to play the Giants that day – announced his intention to write a biography on Grange.^[1][12]  There was also talk of Grange participating in a boxing match (he was an amateur boxer in college), but he shot it down.^[13][14]  The night before the Tampa game, Grange was arrested for speeding at 65 mph (the speed limit was 45), but he wasn't alone; golfers Jim Barnes and Johnny Farrell and Olympic swimmer Helen Wainwright accompanied him in the car.  After listening to the officer's lecture and apologizing, the four attempted to pay for their release in cash, which he was hesitant to accept until he took $25 from Grange to let them go.^[15]

January 1, 1926 saw the Bears take on the [Tampa Cardinals, featuring the great Jim Thorpe](https://i.imgur.com/h6ZdQVB.jpg).  Although he was 41 at the time and in the twilight years of his athletic career, Thorpe decided to join the Florida league to boost publicity.  That decision did not work out for him as he struggled to keep up, fumbling multiple times.^[1]  On the other side, Grange scored on a 70-yard run to break a 3–3 tie, followed by Sternaman's six-yard run to secure a 17–3 victory.^[16]

In the eyes of *Tampa Tribune* writer Marvin McCarthy, the game was proof that pro football may not be so bad after all, as Tampa fans showed plenty of enthusiasm as they rooted for their team to ""show those Bears up.""  Dr. H.E. Opre, who helped organize the event, was asked if ticket sales would cover expenses, to which he responded, ""That doesn't matter.  We are seeing a good football game.  There is enough good land in Florida to make up whatever I lose on today's game.""^[16]

Shortly before leaving for the next game, Grange and Pyle decided to invest $17,000 each in the city's real estate, which ultimately turned out to be a bad idea when hurricanes brought an end to the Florida land boom.^[2]  A day after the Tampa game, Nevers and his all-star team welcomed the Bears to Jacksonville.  The Stanford star kept the Illinois great at bay, recording two interceptions and stuffing Grange on multiple occasions.  To combat Nevers, the Bears opted for a quick passing attack that paid off as Grange threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Verne Mullen, with a second touchdown also coming through the air.^[1]  Later in the game, Nevers lost a fumble that was returned for a TD, and although he scored late in the game, it was effectively in garbage time as the Bears won 19–6.^[17]  During the game, Mullen got into a fight with another player, sparking a brawl that was broken up by his teammates and police.  Game promoters lost $12,500, but did not express worry as they were confident the money could be made up with later games.^[18]

Before continuing their tour out of state, Halas' family decided to call it a trip.  His wife Minnie, two-year-old (turning three in a few days) daughter Virginia, and newborn son George ""Mugs"" Jr. elected to return to Chicago rather than keep going with the team.^[19]

""My brother had been born that September 1925, and [the tour] was just before my third birthday, so I don’t have any real memories,"" Virginia Halas McCaskey said in a June 2019 interview with NBC Sports Chicago.^[19]  ""But I have heard many stories about the traveling on the train with my mother and her sister, my aunt. And we went as far as Florida and then decided, my mother decided we would go home and not make the trip to California.""

##Go West, Young Red

Afterwards, the Bears enjoyed a week off, during which they ""lapped up some more sunshine and gorged themselves with shrimp,"" as Grange quipped.^[1]  Once they finished their time in Florida, the team traveled to New Orleans to play Tulane captain Lester Lautenschlager and his all-star group of players from other colleges in the South.^[20]  Chicago easily handled New Orleans as Grange recorded 136 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 14–0 shutout (he also had a 51-yard punt return nullified by a holding penalty).^[1]

From Louisiana, the team went westward to Los Angeles, California.  This was actually not the first barnstorming tour to reach the Golden State, let alone involving an NFL team; in 1920, the then-APFA champion Akron Pros conducted a tour of the state, though there was obviously not as much fanfare as there was for the Bears'.^[2]  While going around town, Grange was surprised to discover a street in nearby Glendale had been renamed Grange Street in his honor (thanks to a city council member being a big football fan).^[1]  He also met [famed botanist Luther Burbank while in California](https://i.imgur.com/2lqVpVc.png).

On game day, [the Bears](https://i.imgur.com/qlOAWPC.png) took on the Los Angeles Tigers in the Coliseum.  [The game](https://i.imgur.com/TOiPj5y.jpg) was met with great excitement when All-American halfback [George ""Wildcat"" Wilson of Washington](https://i.imgur.com/yygws7D.png) joined the Tigers, hoping to get a chance to [battle Grange](https://i.imgur.com/zedqgIH.jpg).^[21]  In front of what was considered one of, if not the largest crowd for a football game in the West at the time with between [65,000 and 75,000 fans](https://i.imgur.com/Cdeq8et.jpg), [Grange](https://i.imgur.com/cod7121.png) opened the [scoring](https://i.imgur.com/CJIHhb1.jpg) with a four-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.  Wilson impressed with 126 rushing yards, but also lost a fumble.  Roy Baker scored the lone touchdown for the Tigers, while Joey Sternaman added a TD of his own in the 17–7 victory.^[1][22]  According to game organizer P.S. Halbriter, receipts amounted to nearly $135,000, with approximately $50,000 going to Grange; it was the largest purse Grange had received up to that point in his pro career.^[23]

The following day, the California Stars hosted the Bears on a high school field in San Diego.  Chicago's Oscar Knop scored in the first quarter.^[24]  In a game that he considered himself ""listless throughout"" until very late, Grange played the first half and fourth quarter, scoring on a two-yard run in the latter to clinch a 14–0 shutout.^[1][25]  A day later, Portland Coast Baseball League President Tom Turner announced his plans to convince Grange and the Bears to come to Portland for a game later in January.^[26]  Pyle also expressed interest in taking Grange and the sport overseas to China.^[7]

After another week to unwind, Grange and company went upstate to the Bay Area to [take on the San Francisco Tigers](https://i.imgur.com/1WadsPD.png) at Kezar Stadium.  Once again, Wilson was the leader of their opponent.^[1]  The local Olympic Club led by Babe Hollingbery considered playing, but were threatened in December by club directors with losing their memberships if they did so; when reports surfaced that Hollingbery was helping to promote the game anyway, he denied them and said he had been offered $5,000 to coach in the game but took no other action.  Instead, Olympic Club member ""Buck"" Bailey took the reins as coach.^[27]

Although the Bears were 2 to 1 betting favorites, the Tigers' James ""Rabbit"" Bradshaw surprised with two interceptions (one off Grange), a 43-yard fumble recovery, and a 33-yard punt return.^[28]  Teammates Bob Fitzke and [Houston Stockton](https://i.imgur.com/xRxUfeo.png) scored two touchdowns in the Tigers' 14–9 upset, while Wilson outperformed [Grange](https://i.imgur.com/fCTrVb6.png) with 87 rushing yards against the latter's 41 until Wilson suffered a head injury in the fourth quarter (Stockton also exited the game, though with a leg injury).^[1][29]  The Bears' lone touchdown was a 20-yard throw by Sternaman to Paul Goebel.^[28]

On January 30 and 31, Turner's words became a reality as the Bears visited the Pacific Northwest to play all-star teams in Portland and Seattle.  And guess what?  Wilson was their captain.  Yes, for both teams.  He agreed to play under the conditions that he gets paid in advance and game organizers provide him with a good offensive line; as Wilson explained, ""The Chicago Bears have the biggest and best line I ever saw on a football field.""^[30]  He got his request as the rosters drew their players from the Waterfront Athletic Club; to quote the United Press, these players were ""made up of a bunch of husky longshoremen, hard as nails, who are in the best of condition and ready to fight.""^[31]

In the days leading up to their Northwest slate, uncertainty surrounded Grange, whose contract with the Bears was set to expire at week's end.^[32]  But we'll get to that once we finish the tour.

With a ""small but highly critical crowd"" of between 5,000 and 6,500 watching, Grange and the Bears slaughtered Wilson and the Longshoremen 60–3.^[33][34]  The [Illinois duo of Grange and Britton](https://i.imgur.com/nxsz7et.png) had a field day as the latter recorded a hat trick of TDs, while Grange scored twice in the first half on a 15-yard touchdown pass from Laurie Walquist and a 45-yard TD run.^[35]  However, Grange did not complete the game as he was hurt in a pile-up shortly before the first half ended.^[1]  On Wilson's side, he never had a chance to do anything, only being on the field for six of his team's offensive snaps before he joined Grange in exiting prior to halftime.^[34]

The next day, Chicago wrapped up the tour against Wilson's Seattle All-Stars, comprised mostly of the same players on Portland.^[1]  During the second quarter, Grange was breaking away on the verge of scoring an easy touchdown when Wilson tackled him; Wilson hurt his right leg on the play and was knocked out of the game.^[36]  While on the topic of injuries, Wilson's teammate Rollie Corbett broke his leg during the game, prompting Grange, Pyle, and Wilson to set up a fund to help out; the three donated $50 each.^[37]  Grange had two touchdowns — a 36-yard run and a 31-yard pass — and 99 rushing yards on nine attempts before watching the second half from the sidelines.  The Bears won 34–0.^[36]

When the gun sounded in Seattle, Pyle gave Grange his final check of his rookie season: $50,000.  ""Counting the money I drew weekly, I had earned nearly $125,000 in my first season as a professional football player.  Charlie had kept his word.  Now I thought I could go on to make it a million.""^[1]

After 19 games in 66 days, the tours were finally complete.  Grange concluded:^[1]

&gt; The Bears' eight-game exhibition series wasn't nearly as hard on any of us physically as the ten-game 
schedule that followed my joining the team on Thanksgiving Day.  I found it no strain to play a minimum of thirty minutes in every one of the games on the winter trip.  What made the difference was the fact that we had five and a half weeks in which to play the eight tilts, besides having four more teammates to share the load. Nevertheless, we were all in need of a good long vacation.

&gt; The Bears had played a total of twenty-eight games from the start of their season early in September 1925, and I had appeared in twenty-four contests counting the eight games of my senior year at Illinois.  When I became a member of the Chicago Bears it was considered a move of such importance in the sports world, many of the outstanding sports writers of the day like Westbrook Pegler, Ford Frick and Damon Runyon were assigned by their syndicates and papers to travel with the team.  They wrote about anything and everything that happened to me. Because of the reams of copy given over to me and the tremendous public interest it stirred up, the Bears were able to attract over 360,000 fans in eighteen games from Thanksgiving Day, 1925, to January 31, 1926.

&gt; More than 150,000 of this impressive total was recorded on the exhibition junket that started Christmas Day. We 
covered one end of the country to the other, making in excess of 7,000 miles in the swing from Coral Gables to Seattle and back to Chicago again.  We made enough pro-football converts all over the land to give the sport the shot in the arm it so badly needed and, from the 1925 season on, professional football began to grow steadily in popularity.

#Epilogue: Beyond the Tour

##Lights, Camera, Action

Grange and the Bears returned to Chicago the Thursday after the game, from which he went home to Wheaton for a break before going to Los Angeles to work on his movie that had been brought up a few times in the first two parts.^[38][39]

The film in question, *One Minute to Play* by FBO Studios, featured Grange as Red Wade, a high school football star who wishes to attend Claxton University and play for their prestigious team.  However, his father John (portrayed by Charles Ogle), who hates football, orders him to quit and instead attend Parmalee, a school down on its luck financially and on the football field.  Regardless, Red stands by his choice and chooses Claxton.  On the train ride to Claxton, he meets Sally Rogers (Mary McAllister), the sister of Parmalee head coach Tex Rogers (Lee Shumway), and ends up in a brawl with Claxton team captain/Sally's love interest Biff Wheeler (Hendricks) that knocks him out.  When he recovers, Red learns the train had taken him to Parmalee, but decides to stay after his pet dog leads him to a reunion with Sally.  Although he initially follows his father's words and doesn't try out for the football team, the urge to play is too strong and he does so anyway.  With Red leading the way, Parmalee wins its first game in years.^[40][41]

When John finds out about his son's on-field success, he confronts Red the day before the Parmalee/Claxton game and threatens to pull a $100,000 endowment he had made to the university.  That night, Red pretends he is intoxicated to get out of playing, leading to Tex benching him.  The next day, John attends the game to make sure Red isn't on the field, but starts to develop genuine interest in the action and realizes his mistake.  Coach Rogers is reluctant to let Red play, but with Parmalee trailing 6–0 with not much time left, he sends him in.  With one minute to play, Red scores the game-winning touchdown and extra point.  And yes, he gets together with Sally in the end.^[40][41]

For the climactic Parmalee/Claxton game, Wilson appeared as a player on the Claxton team.  Since the game action scenes were shot at California's Pomona College in summer while the film's setting is the Midwest in autumn, the director struggled to figure out how to get extras to participate in the heat.  Considering their rivalry on the tour, Pyle suggested advertising the scene as an exhibition game between Grange and Wilson, with fans being granted free admission if they arrived in fall clothing.  15,000 extras turned up.^[1][2]

After the movie premiere, FBO Studios head Joseph P. Kennedy reached out to Grange and asked if he would consider retiring from football to become a full-time actor for the company; he declined.  ""If you've never seen Red Grange play football, now's your chance, for he plays it like every thing in this picture,"" a *Chicago Tribune* movie critic under the newspaper's popular pseudonym Mae Tinee wrote.^[1]

Grange went on to work on other productions like *A Racing Romeo*, an auto racing movie that allowed him to connect with early motorsports great Barney Oldfield, and the 12-chapter series *The Galloping Ghost*, an action serial that saw him perform his own stunts including vehicle chases and explosions.^[1]

##The Yankees and the Rebel League

So *One Minute to Play* did alright and people loved Grange's acting, but what about his future with the Bears?  Well, with the 1926 season nearing, Pyle approached Halas and Sternaman about buying a part of the Bears.  As Pyle argued, if the team wanted to thrive, they should continue to capitalize on Grange's celebrity status.  However, the two rejected his offer.^[1]

Severing ties with the Bears, Pyle and Grange decided to start their own team in New York.  They received a five-year lease at Yankee Stadium and sought to place their ""New York Yankees"" in the NFL, but Giants owner Tim Mara – the man whose franchise had been saved by Grange's tour in December – did not want to give up his territorial rights.^[1][39]

Out of options, Pyle did what any reasonable businessman looking to break into pro football without the NFL would do: start his own league.  Dubbed the American Football League, the new group consisted of nine teams: the Yankees, the Chicago Bulls (yes, the Bulls), the Cleveland Panthers, the Brooklyn Horsemen, the Boston Bulldogs, the Newark Bears, the Philadelphia Quakers, the Los Angeles Wildcats, and the Rock Island Independents.  The Independents came over from the NFL, while the Wildcats were led and partly owned by Wilson, who continued his association with Pyle and Grange when he signed a contract with them.^[1][42]  The Bulls featured two of Grange's former Bears teammates in Johnny Mohardt and Joey Sternaman; with the Chicago Cardinals moving to Normal Park for the 1926 season, the Bulls took over as the football team of Comiskey Park.^[1][43]

Spoiler alert: the AFL lasted just one year as financial issues plagued many of the teams.  Discussing the lone season is probably enough to be a story for another time.  Until then...

Tell me if this sounds familiar.  Grange and Pyle, seeking to make it big, embark on a barnstorming tour to bring legitimacy to a fledgling football league.  After the 1926 season, they did it again.  Joined by a team created by Wilson dubbed Wilson's Wildcats, the Yankees toured California and Texas on a ten-game schedule.^[1]

Although he played in every game, the slate was relatively unremarkable for Grange.  In fact, his ""only memorable part of the tour"" was when he and his teammates were arrested at a Dallas hotel at 4 AM for disturbing the peace and supposedly being intoxicated, the latter of which they denied.  According to reports, the team walked into the hotel lobby, where they proved to be too loud for the hotel manager who called the police on them; Grange explained they were looking for a nightlife spot to hang out and an officer had recommended the hotel.^[1][44]

When police arrived, teammate Pooley Hubert began arguing with a large policeman and was thrown at a seat against the wall.  The hotel proprietress ordered them to leave and said there were no rooms available, but Grange commented they weren't looking for a place to stay.  From there, the players were loaded into police cars and sent to jail, where they stayed until they were released after paying $10 fines each.  Since they had a game to play in Beaumont, they elected to pay the fines instead of fight the rulings in court.^[44]

""We had no idea it would turn into such a hullabaloo as this,"" Grange said after the arrest.^[44]  ""If we had felt guilty we could have easily given fake names.

""To this day I'm trying to figure that one out,"" he remarked in his autobiography.^[1]

Although the AFL died, Pyle reached an agreement with the NFL to assimilate the Yankees into the league, and Grange remained with the team.^[1]  In 1927, his career came into doubt during a game against the Bears; although he averaged five yards per carry and recorded an interception, the Yankees fell behind 12–0.^[45][46]  Late in the fourth quarter, teammate Eddie Tryon threw a pass to Grange, who was hit by Bears center [George Trafton](https://redd.it/9rvxk1).  As Grange landed, his cleat caught in the field.  Trafton then fell on Grange, causing the latter to twist his right knee.  His injury was revealed to be a torn tendon, which was aggravated when it swelled and water began to form.  He underwent diathermy to treat the leg, but his running ability was effectively ruined.^[1][47]

""After it happened, I was just another halfback,"" Grange said.^[46]

Despite his knee, Grange returned to action just four weeks later — mostly due to contractual obligations — against the Cardinals, though at quarterback.  The Yankees won 20–6, but he exacerbated the injury.  Regardless, he continued to play and finished out the season.  For the third straight year, he participated in a winter barnstorming tour.^[1]

Prior to the 1928 season, Grange's contract with Pyle expired and the two formally parted ways, ending their three-year partnership.  While the Yankees dragged along to a 4–8–1 record before Pyle shut down the operation for financial issues, Grange — who had sold his stake in the team — sat out the entire year.  Instead, he and his father decided to join Chicago movie distributor Frank Zambreno on a nationwide vaudeville tour.^[1]

Grange returned to the Bears in 1929.^[48]  Although he wasn't as electric of a runner as he was before the injury, he was still a contributor to the Bears' 1932 and 1933 championship teams, including catching the [game-sealing touchdown in the former's playoff game on a controversial score that ultimately helped shape the NFL's passing attack](https://redd.it/8z548w).  He retired after the 1934 season, but remained with the Bears as the backfield coach for the next three years; Halas had even offered him the head coaching position if he wanted it, but he declined.^[49]

""I was highly flattered by Halas' offer, but didn't think I had enough experience for the job,"" Grange wrote.^[1]  ""Besides, I never had any ambition to be a head coach in either the professional or college ranks.""

He was a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's inaugural class in 1963.^[50]

##Pro Football's Future

With both tours now in the history books, this brought up some questions: Was it a success?  Did it help pro football?

The answer to that is... kind of?  Maybe not?  As the *Chicago Tribune*'s Don Maxwell wrote, you could make cases for both sides; on one hand, attendance was quite unimpressive (especially in Florida), game organizers lost money, Grange and Pyle didn't make as much cash as they had expected, and Grange's teammates like Joey Sternaman outperformed him in the games.  On the other hand, Grange's presence still attracted plenty of interest, especially on the West Coast, and the total money he made was more than he ""could have made in any other business in the same period.""^[51]

Others were more cynical.  In a 1991 article published a week after Grange's death, Vito Stellino of the *Baltimore Sun* questioned Grange's impact on pro football and compared him to Herschel Walker's decision to join the United States Football League; although Walker was a high-profile signing, the league still died after a few years.  Instead, he said television was what made the NFL.^[52]

""But there's no point in even trying to puncture the myth,"" Stellino wrote.^[52]  ""It's too embedded into the American sports psyche to disprove now. Anyway, it's a better story than the reality.""

Historian John M. Carroll noted that among critics, the tours led to the belief that pro football was a circus led by certain stars, which could prove dangerous if such stars decided to play while hurt for the sake of bringing people to the games (as exhibited by Grange's injuries during the first tour).  Some also feared the possibility of rigging certain game events like scores to favor the superstars and raise fan interest; Brooklyn Dodgers owner/player John ""Shipwreck"" Kelly even said he had reached an agreement with Halas and the Bears to let Grange record a long run in a 1934 postseason exhibition game held in Knoxville, Tennessee.^[53]  Ironically, Kelly had a long run of his own with a 90-yard kickoff return touchdown in the exhibition, the last score of the game in the Bears' 20–6 victory; on the previous drive, Grange clinched the win with a five-yard touchdown reception.^[54]

However, Carroll also added Grange helped speed up the NFL's development from a small-town group to a national, big-city league by the early 1930s as he proved pro football could draw a crowd, especially during the first tour.^[53]

""Because there are so many variables to consider, it is difficult to state with certainty Grange's role in the
rise of professional football,"" he wrote.^[52]  ""We can safely say that Grange did not save a faltering NFL in 1925.  The preponderance of evidence suggests that Grange's emergence as pro football's first real superstar propelled the NFL and pro football in general forward in establishing the game as a major league sport.  The line of progress was halting and certainly Grange was only one of the forces that contributed to the rise of pro football.  But Grange deserves some of the accolades accorded him as a pivotal individual in the emergence of the professional game.""

In a February 1926 interview with the UP, Grange stood behind his decision to leave Illinois early for the pros, but also voiced his support for a rule prohibiting college players from going pro until they graduate.^[38]  Of course, this became a thing with the Red Grange Rule passed in 1926 and discussed in Part 1.

Despite the skepticism and attacks from the college level, he expressed his optimism for pro football:^[39]

&gt; ""Certainly, I am sold on the future of professional football.  I believe it is headed for much the same position now held by professional baseball.

&gt; ""[Pro football] is a much better brand of football, but lacks the intense rivalry of a school nature.  I cannot see where it will detract from college football.

&gt; ""About the best statement I have read is one written by Bill Tilden recently, in which he said the colleges have now commercialized the game, and the only difference between the two in the fact that college players get nothing for their labor.""

Based on how it's evolved in the 90+ years since, things ultimately worked out quite nicely for pro football, didn't it?

##Red's Reflection

Decades later in 1985, Grange reminisced about the start of his pro career, his celebrity status, and the tours' influence on the league during a conversation with a ""visitor"" that was covered in a *Sports Illustrated* article by John Underwood:^[55]

&gt; ""You didn't graduate, which I suppose at the time was perceived as a bad thing for college sport,"" the visitor said. ""Do you regret it?""

&gt; ""Well, I never had anybody ask me for my diploma, if that's what you mean. But I suppose I resent it a little that people mistake a lack of a diploma for a lack of brains. I was a good student. Hell, I had all kinds of trigonometry. A lot of people think if you play football you're dumb, but if you play golf or tennis you're smart.

&gt; ""The thing is, I had a chance to make some money, a lot of money for me. When Herschel Walker got his chance, I couldn't blame him. I don't see how you can turn down four or five million dollars, no matter what anybody thinks. Ten or 15 years from now there'll be new Herschel Walkers. Herschel Walker has to take care of himself.""

&gt; (Wife) Muggs returned, holding up a pair of old football pants. They were the color of dead leaves, and beneath the stark weave of their canvas skin the mysterious bulges of protection stood out like large welts. The pants had a formidable, inviolate look, as if they were capable of sweating on their own. The old man sitting in the chair smiled and turned over the belt for the visitor to see the inscription sewn inside: RED GRANGE MODEL. ""I never wore these,"" he said. ""They were sent to us by an Indian in Oklahoma.""

&gt; ""They were one of your endorsements?""

&gt; ""I endorsed everything there for a while.""

&gt; ""Tell me about Cash and Carry Pyle,"" the visitor said.

&gt; ""Dapper, that's the first word that comes to mind. He went to the barbershop every day of his life, and he was immaculate. He wore that derby and spats and carried a cane, and he had that neat little mustache. The greatest ladies' man you ever saw. He was married five times, three times to the same woman, and despite everything you might have read, he was one of the most honest men I ever knew.

&gt; ""Charlie had more good ideas than any 10 men about how to make a buck. He'd made and lost a million three or four times. If he were active today, there'd be no end to the money he'd make. But he was straight with me from the start. He owned two theaters in Champaign. One night I was in there and the usher said, 'Mr. Pyle wants to see you.' I thought he was going to give me a couple of passes.

&gt; ""I went into his office and he said, 'How'd you like to make $100,000?' I said, 'You've got the wrong guy. I don't do things like that.' He said, 'I'm talking about playing pro football. I'll guarantee you that much.' I said, 'Well, I'm interested.' I was only with Charlie for about three years, but I got everything he said I'd get, and more.""

&gt; What you have to remember about the times, Grange said, ""was that there just didn't seem to be a future in football. Now, of course, the game gives so many atha-letes a chance, and that's good. There's money in it, and when you're at your prime you should be able to pursue it. I told (Illinois HC) Zuppke, 'I've played three years. I've got more than three years left. I've got my life ahead of me. Are you going to take care of me until I'm 60?'

&gt; ""We had some terrific arguments in his kitchen. He'd close the door and keep Mrs. Zuppke out. I said, 'You teach football, I'll take care of Grange.' I just couldn't accept the fact that it was all right for him to coach football for his life and not for me to play it. But most people take care of themselves first, and that's what he was doing. 
The colleges were scared to death that the pros would lure away their players with money.

&gt; ""That's why I did it, of course. Football itself wasn't that important to me. But I went from having nothing to owning two or three cars at a time. I bought my father a $25,000 house, which was an expensive house in those days. I spent money like it was going out of circulation, until I learned better. I was a big shot. I drank Dom Perignon champagne. I wore a raccoon coat. I'd go into a restaurant and order from the right side of the menu. 
After I became a pro, if something I ordered didn't cost $20, I didn't want it.

&gt; ""It was fun, but I don't think it was a good phase of my life. I noticed one thing that still seems to apply. Once you start getting paid to play, the crowds treat you differently. I got booed for the first time as a pro. It was a new feeling. I can understand it, though. They expect you to play up to what you're being paid. When we made that tour, the crowds only cared that I produced. They didn't care if I was tired or beat-up. I can't blame them. But it made football different for me.

&gt; ""I don't have any complaints. I've lived the way I wanted, done what I wanted. I don't owe anybody. I couldn't be this way if it weren't for football. But I wonder now and then how the other guys are doing, guys who helped make the pro game, guys who played even after I did.

&gt; ""Pro ball in the early days got two or three inches on the third page. After we made those tours, it was getting top headlines. We spread the NFL across the country, taking it to towns that never saw a pro game, doing anything to push the product. We played in Memphis one year, and after the game started, we were driving for a touchdown when the promoter came running on the field and told everybody we'd have to start over. The backer of the game was the founder of the Piggly Wiggly stores, Clarence Saunders, and he'd gotten caught in traffic and missed the kickoff. So we started over.

&gt; They're benefiting today because of the things we did. And isn't it too bad that the NFL never took care of those early players? I complained a few times, because we had guys in hospitals, guys who had had amputations because of football injuries. Guys who had problems. I thought the game could have done something for them, but it never did. As far as I know, pro football hasn't done anything for anybody except lately, and that's mostly for itself. I never made a real stink about it, but I was sad for the oldtimers.""

&gt; [...]

&gt; It must have been an exciting time, the visitor said, ""and to be so well known.""

&gt; ""Well, something always happens to keep you in line. When Pyle took us to Washington, Senator McKinley of Illinois sent a car around to take Halas and me to the White House to meet President Coolidge. He said, 'Mr. President, this is Mr. Grange and Mr. Halas. They're with the Chicago Bears.' Mr. Coolidge said, 'Glad to meet you fellows. I always did like animal acts.' He didn't know anything about football, which is maybe the way it ought to be.""

&gt; Finally, the visitor got up to leave. Grange seemed sorry to see him go and invited him to come back ""anytime."" 
As they walked to the rented car, the visitor noted that the birdseed was all gone. He recalled what Zuppke had said about Grange. Zuppke had once seen a deer bound by in a national park, and he stopped his car and exclaimed aloud, ""There goes Red Grange!""

&gt; The visitor recited the story for Grange and told how Zuppke, years later, had remarked, ""They can argue all they want about the greatest football player who ever lived. I was satisfied I had him when I had Red Grange.""

&gt; The Galloping Ghost laughed. ""I played football the only way I knew how,"" he said. ""If you have the football and 11 guys are after you, if you're smart, you'll run. It was no big deal.""

So did Red Grange save pro football?  Probably not, but he was the icon of the early NFL, a sign of the nascent league's potential to become something big.  He might not have set the nation on fire, but his legend was more than enough to prove pro football might be here to stay.

And it did.  Not a bad way to be remembered, eh, Red?

The article was talking about the 2000 Dolphins, the last team in franchise history to win a playoff game. McDuffie spent eight seasons with the Dolphins from 1993-2000, and even led the league in receptions in 1998. Relevant portion of the article:

&gt; Players from the 2000 team recall their squad as being full of proven veterans who showed the ropes to the young core of talented, rising stars.

&gt; “That locker room was nice,” wide receiver O.J. McDuffie said. “When I got older in my career, those young guys really took over and they were all outstanding between Sam (Madison) and Zach (Thomas) and JT (Jason Taylor) and Tim (Bowens). They were unbelievable people and leaders.

&gt; **“I don’t see these guys stepping up as leaders,”** McDuffie said of the recent Dolphins. **“Those guys became leaders, and they did it on and off the field. Those dudes refused to lose. We lost a game, and those guys are pissed off on the road trip home. Dudes now, they’re more worried about where they’re going afterwards. ‘Where are we going when we get back to South Florida?’**

&gt; “To hell with that.”

&gt; Until the Dolphins gather another group as talented and seasoned as the 2000 team, fans will cling to the memory of their last playoff victory, a hard-fought game won by a hard-fighting team.","Former Dolphins WR OJ McDuffie on the current state of the team: ""I don’t see these guys stepping up as leaders.""",post

ThatPackerFan,t3_c71uc8,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 33: 1952 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 28-December 14, 1952

Teams: 12

1952 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1952 First Draft Pick: Bill Wade, Quarterback from Vanderbilt University (Los Angeles Rams)

1952 NFL Championship Game: Detroit Lions (9-3-0) defeated Cleveland Browns (8-4-0) 17-7 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, OH.

This season featured the following rule changes:

 \-Offensive players will not be called for illegal motion as long as they do not move forward prior to the snap.

\-The penalty for offensive pass interference is 15 yards from the previous spot, unless the result on a fourth down play is a touchback.

\-A player who commits a palpably (obviously) unfair act is ejected from the game.

Prior to the season, New York Yanks owner Ted Collins sold his team back to the NFL. A few days later, a new team was then awarded to an ownership group in Dallas, Texas, after it purchased the assets of the Yanks. However, the new Dallas Texans went 1–11, and was sold back to the league midway through the season. For the team's last five games, the league operated the Texans as a road team, using Hershey, PA as a home base. One of their final two ""home"" games were held at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, OH, the other one played at the opposing team's (Detroit) stadium. After the season ended, the league folded the Texans, the last time an NFL team failed. This left Dallas without a professional football franchise until the births of the Dallas Cowboys and the AFL version of the Dallas Texans in 1960.

In the American Conference, the Browns and Giants battled all season to take control of the conference, while the Eagles were also involved until the final weeks of the regular season. In Week 1, the Browns avenged their title game loss to the Rams by beating the defending champions 37-7. In Week 3, the Giants beat the Browns 17-9, but the Giants would lose the following week 24-23 to the Cardinals. In Week 7, the Giants beat the 49ers 23-14 while the Browns beat the Cardinals 28-13. In Week 8, the Browns at one point held a 22-0 lead against the Steelers, but managed to nearly lose the game when Jim Finks threw 4 touchdowns to give the Steelers the lead. The Browns would win 29-28 due to a safety. The Giants would lose to the Packers 17-3, giving the Browns the lead in the conference. The Browns would clinch the conference title in Week 12 as the Giants lost 27-17 to the Redskins in Week 11, and the Eagles lost to the Redskins in Week 12. The Browns and Giants met in Week 12 in a meaningless game, and the Browns lost 37-34.

In the National Conference, from Weeks 1-9, the 49ers were either in sole possession of or tied for the conference lead. In Week 2, the 49ers shut out the Lions 28-0, and then in Week 4 decimated the Bears 40-18. The 49ers started 5-0, but in Week 6, they met the Bears again and lost 20-17 after a failed fake punt allowed the Bears to kick a game winning field goal. In Week 7, the Lions beat the Steelers 31-6, and the Rams beat the Dallas Texans 27-6. In Week 9, the Rams beat the 49ers 35-9, while the Bears beat the Lions 24-23, and the Packers beat the Texans 42-14. The Lions, Packers, Rams, and 49ers all were 6-3-0 at the end of Week 9, setting up a battle for the right to compete in the championship game with only 3 weeks left. In Week 10, the Lions beat the Packers 48-24 on Thanksgiving Day and the Rams beat the 49ers 34-21, leaving the Lions and Rams in a tie for the lead. After both teams won in Week 11, this set the stage for the important Week 12 games. The Lions beat the Texans 41-6, while the Rams beat the Steelers 28-14. The Lions and Rams would meet up in a playoff game at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, MI, where the Lions won 31-21 to advance to the championship game.

The 1952 NFL Championship game was the 20th title game in the league's history, as the first 13 champions were crowned by best record. It pitted the Lions against the Browns in Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, OH. The Lions were led by quarterback Bobby Layne, running back Doak Walker, and head coach Buddy Parker, and the Browns were led by head coach Paul Brown and quarterback Otto Graham. It was the Browns' 3rd consecutive NFL championship game appearance since joining the NFL in 1950. The Lions returned to the title game after 17 years, since their win in 1935.

Detroit took the opening kickoff, failed to gain, and punted, with Renfro getting back 11 yards to the Browns' 41. A couple of offside penalties were costly, but the Browns still managed to reach the 18, as Graham was then tossed for an 11-yard loss and the threat ended with Lou Groza missing a field goal from the 25. Detroit then moved up-field, getting to the Cleveland 30, but also failed to score when Pat Harder was short and wide with a field goal bid from 37 yards out.

Punter Horace Gillom punted a short kick, which rolled out at midfield, with the Lions going 50 yards in 7 plays. Layne started it with a pass to Cloyce Box for 10 yards to the 40 and then ran for 13 and another first down on the 27. Layne added nine more before Walker made a first down on the 16, from where Layne passed to Bill Swiacki for 14 yards to the three. After an offsides penalty, Layne would run the ball in for a touchdown and led at halftime, 7-0.

The 2nd half started with the Browns moving steadily, until checked by David's interception. Detroit was halted on this chance with the ball, but clicked the next time when Walker broke away for the touchdown that boosted the lead to 14-0. A Cleveland 3rd quarter touchdown narrowed the lead to 7, but a defensive stand from the Lions from their own 5 along with a late Pat Harder field goal sealed the victory and the Lions' first championship since 1935.

This would be the first of 3 consecutive title game matches between the Browns and Lions. They would meet again in the 1953 and 1954 NFL Championship Games.

Cover1,t3_c6m4gy,nfl,"NFL teams use different color jerseys for their players during practice. Traditionally the offense wears white, the defense wears a dark color and quarterbacks wear red.

But not always.

Here are the Jersey colors for every team in the NFL and some observations at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

|Team|Offense|Defense|Quarterbacks|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Arizona Cardinals|Red|White|Black|
|Atlanta Falcons|Red|White|Black|
|Baltimore Ravens|Purple|White|Black|
|Buffalo Bills|White|Blue|Red|
|Carolina Panthers|Blue|White|Red|
|Chicago Bears|Blue|White|Orange|
|Cincinnati Bengals|White|Black|Orange|
|Cleveland Browns|White|Brown|Orange|
|Dallas Cowboys|White|Blue|White|
|Denver Broncos|Blue|White|Orange|
|Detroit Lions|White|Blue|Red|
|Green Bay Packers|White|Green|Red|
|Houston Texans|Blue|White|Red|
|Indianapolis Colts|Blue|White|Red|
|Jacksonville Jaguars|Teal|White|Red|
|Kansas City Chiefs|Red|White|Yellow|
|Los Angeles Chargers|Blue|White|Blue|
|Los Angeles Rams|Blue|White|Red|
|Miami Dolphins|White|Blue (Aqua)|Red|
|Minnesota Vikings|White|Purple|Red|
|New England Patriots|White|Blue|Red|
|New Orleans Saints|Black|White|Red|
|New York Giants|White|Blue|Red|
|New York Jets|Green|White|Green / Black|
|Oakland Raiders|White|Black|Red|
|Philadelphia Eagles|Green|White|Red|
|Pittsburgh Steelers|White|Yellow|White|
|Sant Francisco 49ers|Red|White|Black|
|Seattle Seahawks|Blue|White|Red|
|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|White|Red|Orange|
|Tennessee Titans|White|Blue|Red|
|Washington Redskins|White|Red|Yellow|

&amp;#x200B;

With that done, here are some observations:

\- White is the most used color which makes sense: 17 teams use it on defense and 15 teams on offense. 2 teams give white to the QB too.

\- 17 teams give the color red to the QB. The second most common color is (surprisingly) orange with 5 teams. 4 teams use black.

\- The primary color of each team goes to the side of the ball not wearing white.

\- Cowboys, Steelers, Jets and Chargers don't have different color jerseys for their QBs. They need to sort this out quick.

\- Teams that wear red on gameday like the Redskins, Buccaneers, 49ers, Chiefs, Cardinals and Falcons use this color for their offense/defense and give the QB another color.

\- Browns and Texans take out their helmet stickers during practice.

\- I don't know what color ST players wear. They match with offense or defense but other than that, each team does their thing.

\- There are only 9 different colors used in practice by teams: black, white, red, blue, orange, yellow, purple, teal and green.

* Bortles for Kesseler

SwingingSalmon,t3_c6r8fo,nfl,"I initially entered this into Google Docs and was just going to share that, but then I learned that because I was logged into and made it with my personal account, if I shared the link, my full name would be attached, so the full version and numbers (for the few there are) are down below.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to call this the first entry in \*\*NFL Randomizer\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I think I know about how the season is going to go, I'm completely wrong. I choose the wrong teams. The wrong players. The people that you don't expect come through in massive ways. What's worse, is that pundits seem to have just as much of a clue as Joe Plumer, so I thought that randomizing the events would make some kind of arbitrary point about the NFL and predictions as a whole.  If this turns out to be accurate, does this mean that Google's random number generator beats ESPN, SB Nation, 538 and the rest?

&amp;#x200B;

So why don't we see how accurate randomization is for standings. Will your team be lucky enough to come out on top?

&amp;#x200B;

Random numbers were generated by [Google's random number generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number). All I did was assign values to teams (1-4) in order from top to bottom how I have them listed below. So the first team that's listed is assigned a 1, the second is assigned a 2, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I clicked the number generator. The first number generated is the winner of the division, the second one is the runner-up, third is third, fourth is fourth. While going through this, I ran into randomizing and hitting the same numbers multiple times in a row. I just omitted that roll and continued until I hit a new number (so if I rolled 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2; then the second team listed was runner up).

&amp;#x200B;

How I listed the teams is used as an example with the AFC East.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy the list. Some that are totally/probably/maybe going to happen, and others where there isn't a chance in hell. But hey, what do I know. that's the point of randomizing. Enjoy.

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Saints|Buccaneers|Jets|~~Falcons~~|
|Bills|Raiders|Chargers|~~Cowboys~~|
|Colts|Bengals |Rams|~~Lions~~|

FireBoop,t3_c79q1p,nfl,"I imagine modern play calling would obviously allow a modern team to destroy a historic squad. However, suppose this is controlled for and we are only concerned with body sizes and other physical attributes (which have steadily increased over the decades). Are modern teams so much superior in these factors that they could even beat the most talent set of players from the 60s? What the squad was assembled from only a single year?

Also, in the title, I wanted to say “The Browns”, but they’re allegedly good now and saying “The Cardinals” doesn’t have the right feel to it.",Could the modern day Lions beat a squad of the best players from the 1960s if they both used similar play-styles,post

First off, I think that the idea of putting the screenshots of the teams in the form worked, because we ended up getting nearly triple the number of votes that we did from Wednesday’s post. Thanks to everyone who submitted that idea, and thanks to everyone who’s staying engaged with this series. Just like yesterday, **when you open the form to vote, the teams will be there so you don’t have to scroll or click back and forth, and you can view a side-by-side comparison.**

Over the past 32 days, we’ve taken a look at the greatest teams of all-time from just one draft spot. We’ve taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #1 picks would look like, taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #32 picks would look like, and everything in between. There’s been a lot of good players, a lot of mediocre players, and a lot of really bad players, and there’s been a wide range in the quality of the teams.

And now, it’s your turn to decide which team is the greatest. Of all the first round draft spots, which one would net the greatest team of all time?

It’s a single-elimination style tournament with standard bracket seeding (#1 plays #32, #2 plays #31, etc.). You get one vote. Whichever team gets the most votes moves onto the next round. Here’s how the remaining schedule is going to look:

- **Friday, June 28:** Elite Eight Voting

- **Saturday, June 29:** Final Four Voting

- **Sunday, June 30:** Championship Voting

Just fill out the Google form for each matchup, and you’re good to go. Today, we’re going to be voting on the Elite Eight. It’s been pretty chalk so far, but that could all change as we are one step away from the Final Four, and one step closer to determining the winner of this whole thing. The bracket and every team is listed in the hub, which is at the top of this post.

ThatPackerFan,t3_c6n7ab,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 32: 1951 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 28-December 16, 1951

Teams: 12 (down from 13 the previous year)

1951 NFL Draft: 362 selections (30 rounds), held in Chicago, IL.

1951 First Draft Pick: Kyle Rote, Halfback from Southern Methodist University (New York Giants)

1951 NFL Championship Game: Los Angeles Rams (8-4-0) defeated Cleveland Browns (11-1-0) 24-17 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-No offensive tackle, guard, or center would be eligible to catch or touch a forward pass.

\-Aluminum shoe cleats are banned.

The 1951 season started with 1 less team than the previous year as Baltimore Colts owner Abraham Watner faced financial difficulties, and thus gave his team and its player contracts back to the league for $50,000. However, many Baltimore fans started to protest the loss of their team. Supporting groups such as its fan club and its marching band remained in operation and worked for the team's revival (which eventually led to a new Baltimore team in 1953).

Coming off their title win at the conclusion of the 1950 season, the Browns opened up the season losing to the 49ers in a 24-10 game. This would cause the Eagles and Giants to battle over the American Conference lead for the first month of the season. The Browns however would not lose after that Week 1 loss and after Browns beat the Giants 14-13 in Week 5 after a missed extra point, they got to 4-1 and in Week 7 knocked off the Eagles 20-17 to keep their lead in the conference which they would not relinquish.

The National Conference was another story, as the Bears, 49ers, Lions, and Rams were in a 4-team race all season long. In Week 4, the Lions would tie the New York Yanks despite having a late lead. In Week 5, the Bears beat the Lions 28-23 while the 49ers beat the Rams 44-17, giving the Bears the conference lead. In Week 7, the Rams beat the Cardinals 45-21 while Lions beat the Bears 41-28 leaving the Bears and Rams tied a 5-2-0. In Week 9, the Lions beat the Packers 52-35, the Browns beat the Bears 42-21, and the Redskins beat the Rams 31-21, which lead to the Lions taking the lead at 6-2-1. In Week 10, the 49ers beat the Lions 20-10, while the Rams beat the Bears 42-17 to reclaim the lead in the conference with 2 weeks to go. However, in Week 11, the Lions beat the Rams 24-22, while the Bears and 49ers won their games making Week 12 very important to those 4 teams as they all were vying for 1 spot in the title game.

In Week 12,  Detroit, which had lost at home to San Francisco a week before, would face them again on the coast on December 16 in Week 12. The Lions led by 3 points in San Francisco with one quarter left, but lost the game 21–17, along with the National Conference title as both teams finished 7–4–1. The Bears were stunned by the Cardinals, 24–14, finishing 7–5–0. The Los Angeles Rams, who had been tied with the Green Bay Packers 14–14 at halftime, poured on 4 touchdowns in the second half for a 42–14 win, an 8–4–0 record, and the right to host Cleveland in the 1951 NFL championship, a rematch from the previous season.

The 1951 NFL Championship was a rematch from 1950, but this time, it was held in the L.A. Coliseum before a crowd of 59,475, which was a record at the title for attendance at a championship game. In the league championship game for the third straight year, the Rams were seeking their first NFL title since moving to California in early 1946 (the Cleveland Rams won the 1945 title, then left for Los Angeles a month later). The Browns were favored to win this title game on the road by 6 points.

The Rams were the first to score, with a 1-yard run by fullback Dick Hoerner in the 2nd quarter. The Browns answered back with an NFL Championship record 52-yard field goal by Lou Groza. They later took the lead with a 17-yard touchdown pass from Otto Graham to Dub Jones, and the Browns led at halftime, 10–7.

In the 3rd quarter, Ram Larry Brink landed a hard tackle on Graham, causing him to fumble the ball, which Andy Robustelli picked up on the Cleveland 24 and returned it to the 2-yard-line. On third down from the 1, ""Deacon"" Dan Towler ran the ball in for a touchdown to give the Rams a 14–10 lead.

Early in the 4th quarter, the Rams increased their lead with a 17-yard field goal by Bob Waterfield. The Browns answered back with an 8-play, 70-yard drive that ended with a 5-yard touchdown run by Ken Carpenter to tie the game at 17–17. 25 seconds later late in the 4th quarter, Tom Fears beat defenders Cliff Lewis and Tommy James and received a Norm Van Brocklin pass at midfield and raced to the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown. It secured a Rams 24–17 win and the 1951 NFL title, their sole league championship in 49 years in southern California.

The next NFL title for the franchise came 48 years later, when the St. Louis Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV in January 2000.

dad_selfie,t3_c66u4d,nfl,"The NFL is an ever-evolving sport.  
  
Typically, the first steps of evolution in the pro game starts in college football. At that level, with so many schools and the highest level talent being concentrated at only a select few of them, coaches are forced to get creative and scheme ways to have success.  
  
We have seen several of these schemes make their way up to the NFL level. In 2012 it was the read-option, In 2015 it was the RPO and last season it was elements of the Air-Raid system.  
  
**The Air-Raid System**  
  
Air-Raid principals have been around for a long time and the general concept of the system is credited to BYU coach LaVell Edwards who implemented a great deal of what you see today into BYU's offense in the late 70's.  
  
Since then, college coaches have expanded on those original concepts to create remarkably robust offenses using strictly Air-Raid concepts. The Air-Raid system is the most Quarterback friendly offense ever conceived. With the quarterback being in shotgun, with a wide open formation, and the ability to make simple audibles at the line, the system inherently creates outstandingly defined and simple reads for the QB. In 2018, the Kansas City Chiefs implemented many Air-Raid principals into their offense and that resulted for an MVP season for quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
  
The front office for the Arizona Cardinals must have been watching the Chiefs 2018 season closely, because in the 2018 offseason, they fired their head coach Steve Wilks after only on season, hired a coach in Kliff Kingsbury who was dismissed from his head coaching job at the college level and a year after drafting quarterback Josh Rosen with the 10th overall pick, selected quarterback Kyler Murray with the 1st overall pick and traded Josh Rosen to the Miami Dolphins. They did all of this for one reason, to run the Air-Raid system.   
  
**Why it is not going to work in Arizona and Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are going to come back to earth;**  

A football field measures 120 yards long and 53 ½ yards wide. This is true in High School, College, and the NFL. The big difference, however, between a football field in College and one in the NFL are the hash marks.  
Now, before we get any deeper, we need to discuss the significance of hash marks.  
  
Most fans do not pay much attention to hash marks as they are seen as an insignificant relic of when NFL players wore leather helmets, but many fans fail to understand that they do affect how the game is played on the field and hash mark are significantly different Saturdays and Sundays. 

There are two hash marks that run parallel to the sidelines, the entire length of the playing field, excluding the end zones. When the ball goes out of bounds on the sideline or a runner is tackled outside of the hash marks, the ball is marked on the closest hash mark. It works this way for both the NFL and college, but the hash marks are not laid out the same at both levels.  
  
In the NFL: Each hash mark is 70’ 9” from the closest sideline. That makes the two rows of hash marks 18’ 6” apart. 
  
In College: The hash marks are closer to the sidelines. The hash marks are 60 feet from the nearest sideline, making the two rows of hash marks 40 feet apart.  
   
**So, why does this matter?**  

For one, narrow hashes in the NFL condense the field of play, as you can’t use the ball being placed on the far hash and all the room you have to the sideline as an advantage.  
  
In the air-raid system, you will routinely see 3, 4 and even 5 eligible receivers lined up on one side of the formation, this presents major problems in spacing for a defense, in the NFL however, there simply will never be enough room to make this possible.  
  
In addition, those wider hashes in the college game alter QB throwing angels making many throws easier than they would be in the NFL.  
  
Over the years, several teams have tried to implement the Air-Raid system to some effect, but no team has had more success doing so than the Kansas City Chiefs in 2018. In the past when teams have used air-raid concepts, the solution for defenses was easy, play nickel and drop a safety down into the box to eliminate “athlete in space” plays.  
 
The reason this approach did not work for defenses facing the Kansas City Chiefs in 2018 can be summed up in two words, Tyreek Hill. With Hill on the field, defenses were forced to play two-deep coverage to ensure Hill would not get behind them, and with Mahomes ability to drive the ball 60+ yards downfield, teams were terrified of the big shot. Consequently, the Chiefs were able to capitalize on underneath space concepts that allowed their playmakers to run wild.  
  
If Hill is unable to play this season due to off the field matters, it will be interesting to see if the Chiefs have the same success, with a diminished big-play threat, defenses should be able to key in on the space plays underneath and trust a single deep safety to eliminate the deep shot. The only other way to get that extra defender out of there is with a supreme athlete at the QB position that would require a spy or contain concept, which brings us to Kyler Murray.  
  
Murray had about as interesting of a run-up to the NFL draft as any player and is certainly the most interesting QB to come into the league since Michael Vick. I completely understand the thought process of the Cardinals brass of bringing in Murray and Kingsbury, however, I do not think they will have success and this is why.  
  
**They are a year late**  
  
As mentioned in the beginning of this writeup, the NFL is an ever-evolving league, we see players like Robert Griffin have outrageous success based off of concepts that catch the NFL off guard but in only one offseason, NFL defenses solve the puzzle and that concept becomes an obscure gimmick that few teams run, from the read option to the up-tempo, to the RPO and now the spread it out, air raid concepts.  
  
You better believe that what the rest of the NFL saw in 2018 from Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs terrified them, and you better believe they spent all offseason cooking up a way to stop it. Just by virtue of planning for the Chiefs, teams are also preparing for Kyler Murray and unfortunately for the Cardinals, they are not going to catch any team off guard.  
  
As for the Chiefs, with a year of planning and Tyreek Hill’s status in question, it might be a rude awakening for them as well.","[OC] Mahomes &amp; Murray, The Air-Raid system, and why the Cards and Chiefs might be in for a rude awakening in 2019.",post

I honestly feel like this sub doesn’t give them enough credit 

Obviously their season is going to come down to which QB starts and how well they perform. But I mean around them? They have a pretty solid team.

Biggest concern other than QB is obviously at WR.

Other than that? 
They have a deep RB core (I think Guice is going to be a stud). 
Arguably a top 3 D Line in the NFL; and a Young D Line at that. 
LB Core needs work but Kerrigan is still a great leader 
O Line is good when healthy 
Jordan reed is GREAT when healthy
Norman is above average even though he’s clearly overpaid 
And not to mention L Collins was one of the better Pickups of free agency.


If Keenum or Haskins can at least Game manage, I can easily see them being 9-7 or even 10-6 with an outside chance at the WC. 

Yes, that obviously isn’t great, but going through this sub lately I’ve seen that team be called the worst Roster in the NFL on paper. And they are almost never given a chance at winning the division. A division that almost always comes down to a couple of games.

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Saints|Buccaneers|Jets|~~Falcons~~|
|Bills|Raiders|Chargers|~~Cowboys~~|
|Colts|Bengals |Dolphins|~~Lions~~|
|Bears|Texans|Rams|~~Packers~~|
|Giants||49ers|~~Vikings~~|
|Browns|||~~Jaguars~~|
||||~~Steelers~~|
||||~~Patriots~~|
||||~~Eagles~~|
||||~~Panthers~~|

Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

WillStatForFood,t3_c67bmi,nfl,"# Introduction

[The dictionary](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/flat-track-bully) defines a flat-track bully as *""a sportsperson who dominates inferior opposition, but who cannot beat top-level opponents""*. This concept began in cricket (a flat-track is very friendly to batters) and has spread to soccer. Romelu Lukaku is frequently criticized as being one. I wanted to see if there are QBs in the NFL who fit this mold, i.e. they only beat up weak defences and shit the bed against stellar ones.

# The Methodology

For every QB's 2018 season, I computed a weighted average of their passer rating, with the weights being a product of the number of attempts (to adjust for the passer rating formula) and their opposition defense's passing DVOA, as measured by Football Outsiders ([check here](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/methods) for more reading on DVOA). The intent being to (relatively) magnify a QB's performance against the elite defenses and diminish their performance against poor defenses. Details on the exact formula are at the end of the post.

# The Table

Without much further ado, here's the results for the 33 QBs that qualify for single season rate stats in 2018, together with their actual passer rating for the year. They're ordered by their DVOA adjusted passer rating, and in the last column, we have the difference between their ranking in this table and their ranking in [the actual passer rating table for 2018](http://pfref.com/tiny/aFe1I).

|QB|DVOA Adjusted Rating|Passer Rating|Rank Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Drew Brees|112.9|115.7|0|
|Patrick Mahomes|110.5|113.8|0|
|Matt Ryan|106.6|108.1|1|
|Russell Wilson|104.9|110.9|\-1|
|Philip Rivers|103.0|105.5|0|

# Observations

* Looks like **Mitchell Trubisky** is your flat-track bully of 2018. This makes sense, since his best games were against some truly terrible passing defenses (passing defense DVOA rank in brackets): TAM (30), DET (31), MIA (23), GNB (28), SFO (27), NYJ (18). He had down performances against really any competent defense he came up against, although some of it is skewed by the fact that he had poor passing numbers against BUF (2) which was a blowout for his team and the fact that he had a terrible game against NWE (13), a game which also had his most attempts (by far) for the season.
* Ryan Tannehill only fared slightly better than Mitch in what turned out to be his final breakout season in Miami. His best games came against OAK (32), NYJ (18) and IND (20). He did have a stellar game against NWE (13) balanced by a truly terrible game against them in Foxboro. He also had a decent and a truly awful game against BUF (2).
* On the other end, Andy Dalton had the highest jump, with Marcus Mariota close behind. It's not like they were really special against tougher defenses (although Dalton's excellent game against BAL (3) early in the season helped him a ton), they were just more consistent than some of the QBs around them, including both Trubisky and Tannehill.
* Apart from these guys, no one else moves more than two spots in any direction. 15 QBs don't move at all, including the bottom seven ones.

# The Formula

DVOA adjusted passer rating =  sum\_over\_all\_qualifying\_games (passer rating for game \* number of attempts for game \* DVOA multiplier for opponent) / sum\_over\_all\_qualifying\_games (number of attempts for game \* DVOA multiplier for opponent)

Some explanations follow:

* To convert a DVOA, which is expressed a percentage point difference from league average with a negative value being better than average for defences, I converted the percentage back to a fraction, switched the sign and added to 1. So the Bears, with a pass defence DVOA of -25.2%, got a multiplier of 1.252. The Raiders, with a pass defence DVOA of 28.3%, got a multiplier of 0.717.
* A qualifying game is any game in which a passer attempts 14 passes or more. So, the only QBs qualifying for rate stats over a season are QBs who attempt 14\*16 or 224 total passes or more. Sit down, young Lamar Jackson.","[OC] DVOA weighted passer rating. Or, is your QB a flat-track bully?",post
sip-em_bears,t3_c68env,nfl,"Below I attempted to make the best team for each of the power 5 conferences. I tried only counting players based off where they played their last season, and which conference that school was in that season (if you catch a mistake, let me know). Note that some positions are far easier to pick than others. Julio Jones for example is an easy WR choice for the SEC team, while picking between Barkley and Zeke for Big Ten RB was far more difficult.

Before I get into today’s matchups, I was able to take your advice of having the teams side-by-side in the voting form so that you didn’t have to click back and forth. **Now, when you open the form to vote, the teams will be there so you don’t have to scroll or click back and forth, and you can view a side-by-side comparison.** Thanks to everyone who recommended this change; hopefully it makes it easier for you guys to determine a winner.

Over the past 32 days, we’ve taken a look at the greatest teams of all-time from just one draft spot. We’ve taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #1 picks would look like, taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #32 picks would look like, and everything in between. There’s been a lot of good players, a lot of mediocre players, and a lot of really bad players, and there’s been a wide range in the quality of the teams.

And now, it’s your turn to decide which team is the greatest. Of all the first round draft spots, which one would net the greatest team of all time?

It’s a single-elimination style tournament with standard bracket seeding (#1 plays #32, #2 plays #31, etc.). You get one vote. Whichever team gets the most votes moves onto the next round. Here’s how the remaining schedule is going to look:

- **Thursday, June 27:** Sweet 16 Voting

- **Friday, June 28:** Elite Eight Voting

- **Saturday, June 29:** Final Four Voting

- **Sunday, June 30:** Championship Voting

Just fill out the Google form for each matchup, and you’re good to go. Today, we’re going to be voting on the Sweet 16. All of these teams won their first round matchup, and are vying for a spot in the Elite Eight; there’s 15 chalk teams left, and then the #24 Pick Team. The bracket and every team is listed in the hub, which is at the top of this post.

FeistyCheesecake,t3_c5tohf,nfl,"In 2010, Aaron Rodgers threw 11 picks. That same season, he led the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl championship. However, since that year, the Packers haven’t been back to the Super Bowl, let alone won the big game. Interestingly enough, he also hasn’t thrown double digit interceptions since 2010 either. This **cannot** be a coincidence. Using my superior statistical analysis model, I have discovered that if Rodgers throws too few picks, his team will not succeed in the playoffs. 


**2011**
In the 2011 season, Rodgers broke the since season passer rating record with a PR of 122.5. He led the Packers to a 15-1 record and won MVP. However, following a first-round bye, the team was upset by the eventual SB champion New York Giants. Why? **Rodgers only threw 6 interceptions during the 2011 season.**


**2012**
In 2012 the Green Bay Packers went 11-5 and won a wild card playoff game! However, the lost in the divisional round to the 49ers who went on to the Super Bowl that season. However, they DID win a playoff game, unlike the previous season, because Rodgers threw **8 interceptions.** More than last year, but still not into the double digits. 


**2013**
Rodgers was injured this season and only managed to play in 9 games, but he doesn’t get a pass for that. He was only able to throw **6 interceptions** in 2013, meaning his team fell victim to a first-round exit, once again at the hands of the San Fran 49ers. 


**2014**
A-Rod had a fantastic 2014 season. He won MVP while throwing for 4300 yards and 38 TDs, and led his team to a 12-4 record. However, Aaron and his team were in for a little playoff heartbreak. Despite making it to the NFC Championship game, the farthest the Packers had made it since winning the Super Bowl, the Seahawks recovered a late-game onside kick and eventually ended up stealing the game in OT with an insane Jermaine Kearse TD catch. The Packers blew a 16-0 lead in this game, but maybe if Rodgers had thrown more than **5 interceptions** during the regular season, they would’ve been headed to the Super Bowl. 


**2015**
This was the season of Aaron Rodgers Hail Mary heroics. An insane December throw in Detroit helped Rodgers propel his team to a 10-6 record with a wild card berth. Rodgers had a solid season, competing just over 60% of his passes with 31 TDs. The Packers were easily able to defeat the Redskins in a wild card game  35-18, but the divisional round matchup vs. the Cardinals is the game I’m sure we all remember. The Packers were down 7 with less than 2 minutes to go at their own 4 yard line, needing a miracle. Luckily, Aaron “Hail Mary” Rodgers cane to the rescue. With two insane throws to Jeff Janis of 60 and 41 yards respectively, the Packers had tied the game up 20-20, sending it into overtime. Sadly, Larry Fitzgerald’s magic was too much for the Packer defense to overcome, and Rodgers would never see the field again that season. Rodgers’ lofty total of **8 interceptions** was tied for his highest since winning the Super Bowl, which is how he was able to keep them in the game so long. However, if he had been able to reach double digits, maybe the Packers could’ve moved on...


**2016**
I’ll admit, this season is a bit of an outlier in my A-Rod Interception Theory. With 6 games to go in the 2016, the Packers were in shambles: a 4-6 record with a 4 game losing streak. Luckily, magic Aaron bowed to “Run the Table,” and that’s exactly what he did. The Packers ended up on a 6 game win streak, winning their division in the process with a 10-6 record. Rodgers threw 40 (!) touchdown passes and somehow led his team back to the NFC Championship game despite only throwing **7 picks**. However, in that game the Packers were obliterated by the Atlanta Falcons 44-21. Rodgers’ interception total was too low for the Falcons to even let the Packers THINK about making the Super Bowl this season. 


**2017**
Once again, Rodgers was injured this year. To be fair to Rodgers, we won’t include this season as part of the data, since he only played in 7 games, less than half of a full NFL season, and his team missed the playoffs entirely. But for the record, Rodgers had only thrown **3 interceptions** before his injury (he threw 3 more in the only game he played after), so the Packers probably wouldn’t have made any noise in the playoffs anyways. 


**2018**
Now THIS is where all my research comes to fruition. Aaron Rodgers had a pretty subpar year by his standards, only throwing 25 touchdown passes, but the Green Bay Packers went an ASTONISHING 6-9-1, missing the playoffs for the first time this decade during a season when Rodgers played all 16 games! And there’s a VERY clear reason why—**AARON RODGERS ONLY THREW 2 INTERCEPTIONS DURING THE ENTIRE 2018 SEASON.** Astonishing! Rodgers should’ve known better than this if he really wanted to win a championship. 

All in all, I’d say my research is 100% accurate, with absolutely no flaws. Sorry Packers fans, but if y’all wanna win another Super Bowl, Aaron Rodgers MUST channel his 11-pick 2010 self and finally reach that double-digit interception milestone again.

claball,t3_c5zhvx,nfl,"During this time of the year, puff pieces about every NFL player under the sun are pumped out for (and by) fans. Predicting who the next players will be to take the league by storm is a popular topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, guys like Xavien Howard, DeForest Buckner and Marlon Humphrey were lauded as prime candidates to make the leap. They all joined the NFL's elite after a season or two of development.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the types of guys who should be given the term ""breakout"". Players who have a season or more under their belt and take the next step after an adjustment period are the real breakout players.

&amp;#x200B;

Rookies who have never played an NFL down shouldn't be applied the same distinction. Most fully expected Saquon Barkley to immediately become one of the NFL's top backs as a rookie. That wasn't a surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to breakout, a player has to have time to ""break-in"" to his role in the NFL. If a player's first season is All-Pro caliber, then he was a star all along. We just hadn't had a chance to actually see it yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent articles on nfl.com have pushed first-year pros Josh Allen, Ed Oliver, Parris Campbell and Deebo Samuel as players set to breakout.  If this is the benchmark, then literally every single rookie is a breakout candidate.

&amp;#x200B;

This is for players who have improved. How can you improved if you haven't shown anything at the professional level yet?

&amp;#x200B;

It's lazy to suggest as your main argument that a player will breakout essentially because he hasn't actually played an NFL snap yet.

&amp;#x200B;

This term needs to be reserved for players who have developed and evolved into who they are today. Not guys who were great from the very start.","Unpopular opinion: The term ""breakout"" shouldn't apply to rookies",post

Pistachio_Pete_,t3_c66o7y,nfl,"Inside the NBA is one of the best parts of sports media right now, as Barkley, Kenny, Shaq, and Ernie have perfect chemistry that is endlessly fun to watch. So, if you were given the task of building the NFL equivalent, what four guys would you want on your team? For the sake of this hypothetical, you can assemble guys from any network so don't worry about overlap or anything like that. Here is my favorite lineup so far:

Rich Eisen: Smart, entertaining host who doesn't take himself or the league too seriously. Can banter about the silly stuff but also really get into deeper analysis. Will keep the ship heading in the right direction.

Deion Sanders: From an entertainment perspective, you can't do much better than Sanders when it comes to NFL personalities. He's loud, he's brash, and he's never going to be afraid to throw out an outrageous opinion.

Shannon Sharpe: You need somebody who will occasionally say some dumb shit but in a way that remains endearing and I think Sharpe walks this line extremely well. He is goofy as hell but I think that's only because he finds all of this kind of silly. Plus, him and Deion would get into it which would be a lot of fun.

Kurt Warner: I admittedly struggled a lot with finding someone for this spot. I think it needs to be a quarterback and while Peyton Manning is probably more entertaining, I also think he'd try to hard to hog the spotlight and be the funniest person in the room. Of course, Romo came to mind but I want him to stay in the booth for now. Instead, I go with a guy who had a great career and seems to have solid insight into the game. But definitely the guy I'm most open to replacing if I'm forgetting somebody.

Overall, I don't think this would be nearly as entertaining as Inside the NBA because you really can't replace the magic Shaq and Barkley. Still, I think this would be a massive improvement over the boring crews we currently see. Who would be your Inside the NFL crew?",What Would Be Your Dream 'Inside the NFL' Line-Up?,post

To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 31: 1950 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 16-December 10, 1950

Teams: 13 (up from 10 the previous year due to the merger with the AAFC)

1950 NFL Draft: 391 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1950 First Draft Pick: Leon Hart, End from the University of Notre Dame (Detroit Lions)

1950 NFL Championship Game: Cleveland Browns (10-2-0) defeated Los Angeles Rams (9-3-0) 30-28 at Cleveland Stadium in Cleveland, OH.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The free substitution rule (any or all of the players may be replaced by substitutes after any play) was restored on a permanent basis. This change paved the way for player specialization in pro football, including three separate units for each team: offense, defense, and special teams.

\-If a backwards pass or fumble goes out of bounds before it is recovered, the team that had control of the ball last maintains possession.

The NFL and the AAFC merged prior to the season, announced on December 9, 1949. 3 AAFC teams — Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts — joined the NFL intact. The players of the former AAFC New York Yankees team were divided up between the New York Giants and the New York Bulldogs (who changed their name to New York Yanks), the Los Angeles Dons and Los Angeles Rams merged, and a portion of the AAFC Buffalo Bills was absorbed into the Browns organization. A special draft was then held by the league's 13 teams to allocate the rest of the AAFC players.

The 13 teams were realigned into the American and National conferences, which lasted for 3 seasons. The merged league briefly flirted with the name ""National-American Football League"", but restored the name ""National Football League"" a few months later on March 3, 1950. Under the alignment, both conferences had a team in New York and Chicago. The ""American Conference"" (formerly the Eastern Division) had 6 teams including the Giants and the Cardinals, and the ""National Conference"" (the old Western Division) had 7 teams including the Yanks and the Bears, as well as the Baltimore Colts.

Baltimore was declared a ""swing team"" and played one game against each of the other 12 NFL clubs. The original intent of the merger was to have the popular Cleveland Browns serve as this team for two years to equally help gate receipts throughout the league, however, this was refused point blank by Paul Brown. Over a 13-week season, one team was idle each week while the other 12 met in the six scheduled games. Each team played a home-and-away game against the other five teams in their conference, one game outside the conference, and one game against Baltimore over the course of a 12-game schedule.

The league also established the Pro Bowl in the 1950 season. Though the league had attempted an all-star game annually between 1938 and 1942, it had cancelled the game because of World War II and did not revive it when the war ended. Unlike the previous all-star game format, which pitted the league's most recent champion against the league's best all-stars, the Pro Bowl would pit two all-star teams, one from each conference, against each other.

Also, the 1950 season saw the first game played outside the United States when the New York Giants played the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Inter-provincial Rugby Football Union in an exhibition match on August 12. The Giants and Rough Riders would repeat the feat in 1951; the Giants handily won both games.

The 1950 season featured some first time occurrences for different teams in the league as television brought a new era to the game. The Los Angeles Rams became the first NFL team to have all of its games – both home and away – televised. The Washington Redskins became the second team to put their games on TV. Other teams arranged to have selected games televised. 

The opening game of the 1950 NFL season was a match-up between the defending champions of the AAFC and the NFL, the Cleveland Browns (AAFC) and the Philadelphia Eagles (NFL). The teams had never met prior to September 16, 1950, and a crowd of 71,237 turned out in Philadelphia. Cleveland won 35-10, with this game being one of the first games to bring national prestige to the league.

The regular season was one of the most competitive in the history of the league up to that point. During the 1st half of the season, the Giants and Browns started a rivalry in the American Conference when the Giants handed the Browns their first shut-out loss ever in Week 3  6-0 and then beat them again in Week 6 17-13. Despite this, the Browns and Giants would be neck and neck through the 2nd half of the season, as the Browns controlled the top spot in the conference until Week 11 when the Giants caught them after beating the Eagles.

In the National Conference, The New York Yanks looked to be the early favorites to win the conference crown as they were 6-1-0 after Week 8, but the Bears and Rams were right behind them. The tide changed in the National Conference when in Week 9, the Yanks lost to the Bears 28-20, while the Rams beat the Packers 45-7 to take the lead in the conference. In Week 10, the Rams beat the Yanks 43-35 to pull away from the Yanks in the conference standings. In Week 11, the Bears knocked off the Rams 24-14 in the most important game of the season to that point to take a half game lead in the conference (8-2 over 8-3). 

On December 3, 1950, all six of the Week 12 games had significance. Taunted as a team that couldn't win a game without passing, the Cleveland Browns won again against the Eagles, 13–7, this time without Otto Graham attempting a pass. There were 17 punt returns, 12 by Philadelphia, both records. In New York, George Taliaferro had a record 8 kickoff returns for the Yanks in a 51–7 loss to the Giants. Both the Browns and Giants stayed tied in the American Conference with records of 9–2–0. Bill Dudley of Washington returned a punt 96 yards for a touchdown in a 24–7 win over the Steelers. In the National Conference, Cloyce Box of Detroit had 302 yards receiving, one yard short of the NFL record, in a 45–21 win over Baltimore. Tom Fears had an NFL record 18 pass receptions for the Rams in a 51–14 win over Green Bay and a 9–3–0 record to lead the division. Meanwhile, the Bears were upset by the crosstown Cardinals, 20–10, dropping them to 8–3–0, a half game behind L.A.

 In the final week, Week 13, the Browns, Giants and Bears were all in must-win situations, while the Rams had finished their season at 9–3–0. The Bears, at 8–3–0, were tied 3–3 with the Lions after three quarters. George Blanda booted a 22-yard field goal and Chicago held on for a 6–3 win to give them a 9–3–0 record and a tie for the National Conference title with the Rams. The Browns and Giants were both at 9–2–0, and both were playing on the road. Cleveland handled Washington 45–21, while the Giants had to fight off numerous drives by Philadelphia to protect a 9–7 win. With ties for first place in both conferences, the NFL title game had to be delayed a week while an unprecedented four team playoff took place. The Giants and Browns would meet in Cleveland, while the Bears and the Rams would meet in Los Angeles.

It was the first of its kind in the NFL as 4 teams all were vying for spots in the NFL Championship Game. As used previously in the event of ties in the standings, playoff games were held. The Giants and Browns met for the 3rd time and despite the previous results of 2 Giants victories, the Browns never trailed in the game, holding on for an 8-3 win, sending them to the championship game. Meanwhile, The Bears and Rams faced off in Los Angeles in 92-degree heat for a spot in the championship game. Again, while the Bears came in having a 2-0 record against the Rams during the season, they were not able to make it a clean sweep. The Rams controlled the game from the middle of the 2nd quarter to the end as they won 24-14 to advance to the championship game.

The 1950 NFL Championship Game pitted the Browns against the Rams (formerly of Cleveland). The championship game took place on Christmas Eve in Cleveland a week after the conference playoffs. The weather was dry, with 28 mph (45 km/h) winds and a temperature of 29 °F (−2 °C). On the Rams' first play after the opening kickoff, Waterfield passed to Glenn Davis for an 82-yard touchdown, giving Los Angeles an early 7–0 lead. Graham and the Browns' offense responded with a drive later in the 1st quarter that evened the score, but the Rams went ahead again by a touchdown on a 3-yard Hoerner rush. Cleveland scored a second touchdown in the 2nd quarter, this time a 37-yard pass from Graham to Lavelli. Groza's extra point attempt failed, however, because of a high snap, putting the Browns behind by one point. Waterfield missed a 15-yard field goal attempt at the end of the first half, leaving the score at 14–13 at halftime.

Cleveland took the lead again in the 3rd quarter on a 39-yard touchdown pass to Lavelli, his second of the day. The Rams responded with a touchdown run by Hoerner and another touchdown quickly thereafter when Motley fumbled and Los Angeles' Larry Brink took it into the end zone. Down 28–20 as the fourth quarter began, Cleveland was helped by interceptions by Thompson and Lahr that put its offense in good field position. On a drive with 10 minutes left to play, Cleveland went for it on fourth down 3 times and made the necessary yards each time, advancing to the Los Angeles 14-yard line. From there, Graham threw a touchdown pass to Bumgardner, who dove to catch it in the corner of the end zone. After several more defensive stands, the Browns had the ball back and drove toward the Rams' end zone as the game drew to a close. Graham fumbled, however, and the Rams recovered with three minutes left. Cleveland's defense held, and Los Angeles punted, giving the Browns the ball back at their own 31-yard line with 1:49 left in the game. Graham scrambled up the middle for 16 yards on the first play, and then turned to his receivers. A pass to Bumgardner and two to Jones on the sidelines, followed by another to Bumgardner, put the ball at the Los Angeles 11-yard line. Graham ran a quarterback sneak on the next play to place the ball at the middle of the field in preparation for a field goal. After a time out, Groza came in and kicked the field goal with 0:28 left on the clock to put Cleveland ahead 30–28. The Rams fumbled the ensuing kickoff and the Browns recovered, appearing to seal the victory. The officials ruled that Groza had kicked prematurely, however, and Los Angeles returned his re-kick to their 46-yard line. An interception by Lahr on a sideline pass stopped the drive and gave Cleveland the win.

The Browns recorded their first NFL championship in their league debut. This came after 4 consecutive AAFC championships in the only 4 years of that league's existence. After the game, NFL Commissioner Bert Bell called the Browns ""the greatest team ever to play football."" Paul Brown later remembered it as the best game he ever saw, pointing to the success both teams had passing the ball at a time when the emphasis was shifting across the league from running to passing. Cleveland and Los Angeles played again in the 1951 NFL Championship, which the Rams won, 24–17. The Browns went on to appear in each championship game between 1952 and 1955, including a win over the Rams in 1955.

Sweetheartscanbeeeee,t3_c6kj3l,nfl,"Just a quick list about something I was thinking about lately. You might notice a general theme of coaches winning off the foundations of their predecessors. Number 5 will surprise you!

**Don McCafferty, Baltimore Colts, SB 5**
Baltimore had reached the Super Bowl two years earlier headed by some guy named Don Shula. After Shula left McCafferty took the Colts to the championship in his rookie year. But in the era of teams owning players, this was exactly the same team as before. Their continued dominance was no surprise. 

**George Seifert, San Francisco 49ers, SB 24**
The 1989 49ers were a behemoth, going 14-2 with one loss being a junk time final game, and destroying the Broncos 55-10 to repeat as champs. But this team would have won with Miley Cyrus coaching. Bill Walsh had retired after the previous Super Bowl and this team wanted to prove that it wasn’t just Walsh’s system that made them good. So they got to business. That was Seifert’s defense to be sure, but Mike Holmgren ran the offense and I doubt Seifert even poked his head into that room the whole season. “We got this, George. Sit back and enjoy the ride.” Seifert won again in 1994 and probably should get credit for that one, even if just as a manager of ego and talent. 

**Barry Switzer, Dallas Cowboys, SB 30**
Similar situation as Seifert, but coming at it from the opposite angle. Switzer took over from Jimmy Johnson, who lost his power struggle with Jerry Jones. Jones brought in his own guy as a show that it was his general managing, not Johnson’s coaching, that won back to back in 92 and 93. But I think the 95 Cowboys wanted to prove that they were Jimmy’s troops, and their victory was some sort of vindication for Johnson. Switzer won because the players wanted to keep it going. And Neil O’Donnell thought Larry Brown was his teammate. 

**Dick Vermeil, St. Louis Rams, SB 34**
The Greatest Show on Turf was Mike Martz, not Vermeil. And then Vermeil retired immediately after winning this, for no reason at all. I think he was ashamed that he got the credit. But I think it’s safe to say Marty was the genius behind this victory. He almost won a real one for himself too, but for the grace of The Hooded One. Speaking of...

**Brian Billick, Baltimore Ravens, SB 35**
Sorry Baltimore, but your first Ravens championship is courtesy of Bill Belichick. Billick rose off the coattails of a winning culture that Belichick started before the team hightailed it out of Cleveland. Billick just happened to be the guy who got the nod next. 

**Jon Gruden, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, SB 37**
Gruden came over from the Raiders to replace Tony Dungy and won a championship in his first season. That team won on the back of the killer defense built by Dungy. Gruden just barely improved the offense. And then they met the Raiders in the Super Bowl, who had basically changed nothing from Gruden’s last year. The fact that his teams sucked from then on shows he didn’t know what he was doing. 

**Gary Kubiak, Denver Broncos, SB 50**
Another case of a supposed offensive genius being brought in to jumpstart the team, and they do win, but only because the defense drags the offense along for the ride. John Fox set this team up. Kubiak to his credit had to survive the de-godding of Peyton Manning, who’s HGH suddenly wore off. But that just shows anyone could have quarterbacked this team to victory. Including Rex Grossman. But probably not Osweiler. 

So that’s my list. I think it’s pretty solid. I think there are also cases out there of teams winning in spite of their coaches not because of them, but that’s probably another list.","Who coached a Super Bowl win but don’t deserve the credit? These guys, that’s who",post

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Saints|Buccaneers|Jets|~~Falcons~~|
|Bills|Raiders|Chargers|~~Cowboys~~|
|Colts|Bengals |Dolphins|~~Lions~~|
|Bears|Broncos|Rams|~~Packers~~|

Here we look at RBs with 100+ rushes.  I calculated the % of time that they were tackled by a single defender (*solo tackle*) and the % of time that they were tackled for a loss.  Click the link for full details or just browse the Top 5 here below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Most Difficult**

1. [Cris Carson, SEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMQcTMxGEZw).  Nearly every other time he ran the ball it took more than one defender to bring him down, ringing in at only 51% of runs being solo tackled and just 6.5% of his run were for a loss.
2. [James Conner, PIT.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6y06uCUEvo)  Connor was solo tackled 53% of the time and ran in 12 TDs
3. [Aaron Jones, GB.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10WLlzuItWA)  Jones was also solo tackled 53% of the time, although he struggled with getting caught behind the line of scrimmage almost 10% of the time.  Still he posted an impressive 5.5 ypc.
4. [Saquon Barkley, NYG.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yePRjzq9gk)  The Rookie of the Year was taken down 54% of the time by just one defender.  He was caught behind the line 13% of the time, but 11 TDs and a 5.0 ypc definitely show his value.
5. [Austin Ekeler, LAC.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPSfewjuiN4)  Ekeler was taken down 56% of the time by a single defender.  He barely made the list, registering only 106 carries, but he made the most of his opportunities with a 5.2 ypc.

**Least Difficult**

1. TJ Yeldon, JAX.  He was brought down 83% of the time by one man.  He made up for it by being tackled for a loss just 3% of the time, 2nd overall.
2. [Tevin Coleman, SF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l5KUCTFWF8).  On running plays, Tevin was brought to the turf 81% of the time by a single defender AND also had a 19% rate of losing yardage.  Yet he still managed to post a 4.8 ypc.  It's all boom or bust for this RB.
3. Gus Edwards, BAL.  He lost yardage on less than 1% of his runs (top in the league) but was frequently tackled by a single man, 78% of the time.
4. Philip Lindsay, DEN.  78% solo tackled and 10% tackled for a loss.  Yet still posted a 1,000 yard season with a 5.4 ypc and 9 TD.
5. Kerryon Johnson, DET.  78% solo tackled, although an impressive 6% TFL (8th overall).  A 5.4 ypc also helped demonstrate his value, despite being fairly easy to bring to the ground.",Toughest RBs to bring down in 2018,post

First off, thanks for the amazing voter turnout. I’m pleasantly surprised at the number of people who voted on the first day of results. If the engagement from you guys is as good the rest of the way as it was on day one, then we’re going to be in for a thrilling knockout round.

Over the past 32 days, we’ve taken a look at the greatest teams of all-time from just one draft spot. We’ve taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #1 picks would look like, taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #32 picks would look like, and everything in between. There’s been a lot of good players, a lot of mediocre players, and a lot of really bad players, and there’s been a wide range in the quality of the teams.

And now, it’s your turn to decide which team is the greatest. Of all the first round draft spots, which one would net the greatest team of all time?

It’s a single-elimination style tournament with standard bracket seeding (#1 plays #32, #2 plays #31, etc.). You get one vote. Whichever team gets the most votes moves onto the next round. Here’s how the remaining schedule is going to look:

- **Wednesday, June 26:** Round of 32 Voting (part two)

- **Thursday, June 27:** Sweet 16 Voting

- **Friday, June 28:** Elite Eight Voting

- **Saturday, June 29:** Final Four Voting

- **Sunday, June 30:** Championship Voting

We split the first round up into two days so that you’re only voting on eight matchups at a time and not 16. Just fill out the Google form for each matchup, and you’re good to go. Today, we’re going to be voting on the right side of the bracket. The bracket and every team is listed in the hub, which is at the top of this post.

therc13,t3_c5x2fg,nfl,"I have an idea about running the ball versus passing data. 

I'll give a bit of background where my idea came from...

 So in the Chinese board game of Weiqi/go, players had traditionally looked for their expected points to be as high as possible as a measure of how far ahead they were of their opponent and therefore looked to consistently gain a larger and larger score (as the belief was that this maximised the Chances of winning). When the AI deep learning software beat the best player in the world it adopted tactics that consolidated its win, (I.E. Looked for just 51% of the points when humans would go for higher scores) rather than do as humans did. 

My question is whether the PFF data is doing what the players did originally and looking for expected yards as a measure of how effective a play is, rather than what I think the Go software would do which is look for the plays that get you 3.34 yards (in three plays to get to 10 yards) as often as possible thereby minimising your chance to win big, buy maximising your chance to win. What do you think?

This is a question of running and passing because teams with top quality RBs have a higher percentage of success gaining 3.34 yards on every running play. Thereby meaning that they consistently “win” (when we are talking about an individual play) more often than more explosive teams with high yards but low percentage throws, which win big but less often.",An alternative way to use analytics.,post

To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 30: 1949 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 22-December 18, 1949

Teams: 10

1949 NFL Draft: 251 selections (25 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1949 First Draft Pick: Chuck Bednarik, Center from the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia Eagles)

1949 NFL Championship Game: Philadelphia Eagles (11-1-0) defeated Los Angeles Rams (8-2-2) 14-0 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

 \-The free substitution rule (any or all of the players may be replaced by substitutes after any play) was re-adopted for one year. The rule was previously adopted in 1943 in response to the depleted rosters during World War II, but repealed in 1946.

\-Plastic helmets allowed again, after being outlawed in 1948.

Prior to the season, Boston Yanks owner Ted Collins asked the league to fold his team due to financial woes, and give him a new one in New York City. This new team would be called the New York Bulldogs. As a result, professional football would not return to Boston until the Patriots began play in 1960.

In the Eastern Division, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh both had records of 4–1–0 when they met in Week 6. The Eagles won 38–7, and kept the lead for the remainder of the season. In the Western Division, the Rams got off to a 6–0–0 start while the Bears were 3–3–0 at mid-season. Though the Bears won all of their remaining games, they never caught up to the Rams, who finished at 8–2–2.

Had the current (post-1972) system of counting ties as half a win and half a loss been in place in 1949, the Rams would have required a playoff with the Bears for the Western Division.

In the [1949 NFL Championship Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-gSjGsgzgc), the Eagles returned to the title game to defend against the Rams. The game is remembered for the driving rain that caused LA Coliseum's field to look like a mud pit. Its paid attendance was 27,980, with only 22,245 in the stadium. 

Despite being the road team, the Eagles were favored by a touchdown in the game. After a scoreless opening quarter, the Eagles got on the board in the 2nd with 31-yard touchdown pass from Tommy Thompson to Pete Pihos. The halftime score would be 7-0. In the 3rd quarter, Leo Skladany returned a block punt for a 2-yard score to put the Eagles up 14-0. The remainder of the game was a defensive battle, in part due to the muddy conditions and the Eagles would hold on to win a 2nd title in as many years.

The following season would feature the addition of new teams from the All-America Football Conference, which included the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and the Baltimore Colts.

EstevezEstevez,t3_c5dtsc,nfl,"Don't let objectivity get in the way of your hot take. Here's a quick list of ways you can massage the stats to fit your ego.

### 1. Use ""Top-N"" or ""Bottom-N"", instead of ""Nth-ranked"".
It is well known that ""Top-3"" sounds more impressive than ""3rd"". Abuse this to match your agenda.

Examples: The LA Rams had a Top-5 offense in 2018 (5th in yds). The New York Giants had a Bottom-10 defense (23rd in pts allowed).


### 2. Switch between ranking by points and yards arbitrarily
Both are commonly used to evaluate performance, but it's easy to pick the one that suits your motives. 

Example: New England's Defense in 2018 was terrible, they were 21st in Yards allowed! New England's Defense in 2018 was great, they were Top-10 in points allowed (7th)!

If there is a significant difference in ranking between the two, here's how to spin the results for a particular team in your favor:

Team ranks better in Points or Yards Allowed? | You want them to look Good | You want them to look Bad
:--|:--|:--
Points | Their Red Zone D is great! Bend but don't break! | Their offense gave them bad field position, it's a statistical anomaly!
Yards | Who cares about yards, you only win by scoring more than your opponents!| They can't get off the field! They allow so many long drives!

### 3. Assign weight to large differences in ranking for stats with low variation
Some statistics do not vary enough to be particularly meaningful, especially when comparing the middle of the distribution. 65% of qualifying passers in 2018 had completion percentage between 64.0 &amp; 70.0. Bonus points for using a statistic that is very hard to attribute to a single player or team. 

Example: Tom Brady was the 18th-ranked passer for completion percentage. He must be terrible! But if he had completed just 3% more of his passes (~1/game), we would have ranked 5th.

### 4. Use Arbitrary Conditions (Cherry-picking)
Keep adding arbitrary thresholds to reduce the sample size until the stat sounds profound, even though it isn't.  

Examples: 

Josh McCown is the fourth QB in NFL history with 2,500+ passing yards, 17+ passing TD's, 3+ rushing TD's with a 67+ Comp. % though the first 11 games of the season.
(credit: [@WBG84 on twitter] (https://twitter.com/WBG84/status/935533608273698816?s=20))


The Jaguars are 2-0 in the Pacific Time Zone when they play there during Week 17 in Oakland (they won in 1997 and 2004 against the Raiders), and are winless under any other scenario.
(credit: /u/JaguarGator9, [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/83ogke/whats_the_most_cherrypicked_stat_you_can_think_of/dvjc6y2/))

### 5. Hide small sample sizes as percentages/ratios

Example: Jarvis Landry should switch to RB, he averaged 20(!) yds/carry in 2018. (3 att, 60yds)

Related: extrapolate small sample sizes in early weeks to full seasons -- 
Ryan Fitzpatrick was on pace for 6,672 yds &amp; 64 TDs after week 1.

### 6. Promote splits against teams with a ""Winning Record"" or ""Playoff Teams""
Also known as ""How to shit on Kirk Cousins"", who famously has a 4-25 record against teams that ended the season with a record over .500. Note that since 2000, teams only win such games 32.5% of the time (i.e. the average winning team wins 67.5% of the time, or an 11-5 season), so it's not unusual for quarterbacks to perform poorly in this stat. Note that teams with a winning record and playoff teams are almost exactly the same list, and the average win rate against eventual playoff teams is 30.8%.",The Not-even-close-to-comprehensive Guide to Underhanded NFL Statistical Arguments,post

Team EPA shotgun vs. Under Center: [https://imgur.com/57uXqg7](https://imgur.com/57uXqg7)

&amp;#x200B;

I continue my recent obsession with delving into why passing out of the shotgun is [half as effective as passing from under center](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c3bn1o/analytics_effectiveness_of_passing_plays_by_type/).  Even when we [adjust for game situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c5erol/analytics_theory_teams_can_increase_their_scoring/).  And [most QBs fit this description](https://imgur.com/MFCE3cV).

&amp;#x200B;

In this post I wanted to break down what the potential impact could be on a team by team basis if they started to slightly shift their playcalling away from shotgun.  I toyed with several methods, including calculating an ""optimal"" balance... but the changes were far too extreme to be realistic.  Any change will be slow and gradual, so instead I elected to look at the current number of Under Center pass plays that each team called and then increase it by 10%, 20% and 30%.  The reason can be clearly understood by looking at a team like PIT or CHI.  They each passed the ball 90%+ from the shotgun formation.  So this calculation assumes that they pass the ball 5, 10 or 15 more times from Under Center instead of forcing them to do so in the hundreds of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Some teams are actually more effective with the shotgun, so on the graph you'll see a negative number.  That just means that they should run the shotgun *more often* when passing the ball.

&amp;#x200B;

One other note: JAX overall pass EPA was a measly 0.0025.  Such a small base size means that *any* improvement will calculate to a very large index.  So high that they were off the chart.  To control for this, I merely capped their ""improvement"" to the 50% above the max of the next largest improved team so that the chart remains readable.

&amp;#x200B;

Takeaway:  The meta analysis of all plays in the league did indeed show that improvement could be made by shifting away from passing out of the shotgun as often.  However, a team's mileage may vary.  It's scary to think that the already potent offenses of the Saints, Pats, Rams, and Eagles could improve by another 10%!",Teams that should pass out of the shotgun LESS OFTEN,post

stpatricksblue,t3_c5t4c1,nfl,"Hey everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

This is purely a thought experiment to hear what everyone else thinks of the pros, cons, and washes of this type of a salary cap/contract set up for the NFL.

&amp;nbsp;

Every single team has to abide by these rules, so no skirting around it. Teams could negotiate the guaranteed, unguaranteed, and signing bonus portions of these cap percentages, but the total amount cannot be adjusted in any way.

&amp;nbsp;

The below table is using the $188,000,000 salary cap figure as an example.

&amp;nbsp;

Contract level | % of cap | Slot spaces | Total % of cap | $ (millions)
:---------|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:
**Max**| 12.50% | 2  | 25% | $23.50
**Major**| 7.50% | 2  | 15% | $14.10
**Mid**| 5.00% | 2  | 10% | $9.40
**Low mid**| 3.00% | 5  | 15% | $5.64
**Low**| 1.00% | 20  | 20% | $1.88
**Min**| 0.75% | 20  | 15% | $1.41

&amp;nbsp;

This would result in having 50% of the cap in the top 6 slots and 50% of the cap in the bottom 46.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, to help teams retain players, any player that enters into their last year of their contract is eligible for an extension at 125% of their current contract - with the extra 25% *not* counting against the salary cap.

&amp;nbsp;

These numbers would look like this:

&amp;nbsp;

Extension Contract level | % of cap | Slot spaces | Total % of cap | $ (millions)
:---------|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:
**E.Max**| 12.50% | 2  | 25% | $29.3750
**E.Major**| 7.50% | 2  | 15% | $17.6250
**E.Mid**| 5.00% | 2  | 10% | $11.7500
**E.Low mid**| 3.00% | 5  | 15% | $7.0500
**E.Low**| 1.00% | 20  | 20% | $2.3500
**E.Min**| 0.75% | 20  | 15% | $1.7625

&amp;nbsp;

Pros:

&amp;nbsp;
 * Spreads money to the lower end of the roster, preventing stars from amassing increasingly huge chunks of the salary cap (specifically, quarterbacks).
 * Help counter mega deals, especially the busts, hamstringing teams for multiple years or massive cap hits when the player is cut.
 * Puts all teams on equal footing for what they can offer, except for re-signing players in contract years.
&amp;nbsp;
 * Players can literally not hold out (this mostly helps the owner/team) because their hands are tied on slots, barring trading a player taking up a higher level slot to free the space.

&amp;nbsp;

Cons:

&amp;nbsp;
 * There will be less mid-level/low-mid level contracts that some teams, like the Patriots, take great advantage of for quality depth.
 * Some positions would be greatly against this, such as quarterbacks and possibly defensive ends and receivers, but the majority of other positions would benefit by a leveling of salaries.

""I want to begin by sincerely apologizing to coach Andy Reid and his entire family for my comments yesterday. What I said has been interpreted by many as hurtful, insensitive, and cold, and in hearing from listeners and re-listening to what I said, I can understand why. 

&amp;nbsp;

""I can barely find the words to even say out loud what some people believed I was trying to convey. I never mentioned, and would never ever suggest, that coach Reid was at fault for his son’s tragic death, or that any parent would be at fault for such an unspeakable tragedy. As a father myself, I cannot imagine the pain of burying a child. Please know that this was not my intention, and was not even on my mind when I made the comments that I did, and if coach Reid or any listener interpreted it that way, I again apologize. 

&amp;nbsp;

""My beliefs on the team’s personnel history are absolutely trivial when compared to actually hurting somebody with my poorly chosen words. I am deeply sorry that I offended so many people. Mostly, I’m sorry if I hurt coach Reid, a man I respect greatly. He deserves better than to have something like this happen that brings up terrible memories. 

&amp;nbsp;

""I have spent a great deal of time and resources over the past several years working with organizations trying to curb the epidemic of teen suicide. I personally know several parents that have lost a child to suicide or a heartbreaking accident. Losing a child will always be my worst nightmare, and I feel truly blessed every day that one of my own children survived a horrible car accident. 

&amp;nbsp;

""The absolute worst thing I could ever say on the air would be to blame a fellow parent for a tragedy they could not possibly prevent. People who know me know this; they know my heart. For those that do not, I can’t change what you think of me today, but I can again say that I’m sorry for my comments, and pledge to be more considerate when choosing my words going forward. 

&amp;nbsp;

""This is on me; I’m paid as a broadcaster to be concise in what I say. My words on Monday’s show left open way too many interpretations, and I’m the only person responsible for that, and the only person to blame. I’ll learn from this mistake, and I’ll work hard to do better, and I hope to one day regain the trust of coach Reid and the Chiefs organization. 

&amp;nbsp;

""I tried to contact coach Reid early this morning to speak with him, father to father, and personally apologize for any pain I may have caused him or his family. I’m told he’s unavailable today, and I understand. I hope he will accept my apology, but I understand if I’m not completely forgiven. I hope to be back soon, and I thank my friends, family, listeners, sponsors, coworkers, and partners that have reached out to support me today.""

Over the past 32 days, we’ve taken a look at the greatest teams of all-time from just one draft spot. We’ve taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #1 picks would look like, taken a look at what a team comprised of nothing but #32 picks would look like, and everything in between. There’s been a lot of good players, a lot of mediocre players, and a lot of really bad players, and there’s been a wide range in the quality of the teams.

And now, it’s your turn to decide which team is the greatest. Of all the first round draft spots, which one would net the greatest team of all time?

It’s a single-elimination style tournament with standard bracket seeding (#1 plays #32, #2 plays #31, etc.). You get one vote. Whichever team gets the most votes moves onto the next round. Here’s how the schedule is going to look:

- **Tuesday, June 25:** Round of 32 Voting (part one)

- **Wednesday, June 26:** Round of 32 Voting (part two)

- **Thursday, June 27:** Sweet 16 Voting

- **Friday, June 28:** Elite Eight Voting

- **Saturday, June 29:** Final Four Voting

- **Sunday, June 30:** Championship Voting

We’re going to split the first round up into two days so that you’re only voting on eight matchups at a time and not 16. Just fill out the Google form for each matchup, and you’re good to go. Today, we’re going to be voting on the left side of the bracket. The bracket and every team is listed in the hub, which is at the top of this post.

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Saints|Buccaneers|Jets|~~Falcons~~|
|Bills|Raiders|Chargers|~~Cowboys~~|
|Colts|Redskins|Dolphins|~~Lions~~|
|Bears|Bengals|Rams|~~Packers~~|
|Giants|Broncos|49ers|~~Vikings~~|
|Browns|Texans||~~Jaguars~~|
||||~~Steelers~~|
||||~~Patriots~~|
||||~~Eagles~~|
||||~~Panthers~~|
||||~~Seahawks~~|

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

For a schedule of posts, you can head over to the [Methodology and Hub Post](https://www.reddit.com/blrm1j). You can follow the links to see past weeks lists and follow ups.
 
Each week will follow roughly the same formula, with a couple of random additions week to week based on conversations in the comments of the current week’s list.
 
To lead off each week you’ll have the lists being discussed so you can get caught up:
 
#PART 1 - POLL
 
The below link below features a quick poll for the players ranked #70 thru 61. Please fill out the poll since I’m sure you’re all itching to let us know what you think!
 
##[User Poll - #40-31](https://forms.gle/o85poi7fpS5abyhz6)*
 
---
 
The second piece each week will be a small write up from one of the Top 100 rankers, explaining their methodology for how they determined their own personal Top 100 list. The hope is that not only will these write ups better inform the readers to our processes, but it is also in the hopes that maybe (just maybe) one of the readers sees them and decides to apply next season to join us.) Please note that not every ranker will give you their full process, so please don’t go after them if they don’t explain something to your liking. Pinging then and asking respectful questions will go a lot further in getting you any answers you are missing.)

# PART 4 - THE SPECIALISTS
 
You all wanted us to rank kickers and punters within the list, according to last year’s polls, but to be totally honest this list has never really been able to quantify the worth of a kicker or punter against other positions because of the lack of meaningful snaps in comparison to other players on the list.
 
For this reason, after rankings had been completed I asked rankers to rank kickers and punters from a list if they wanted to. Those who did ranked 10 out of the top 20 kickers (based on total points in 2018) and 10 out of the top 20 punters (based on gross average per punt). Yes, I am aware that this knocked [insert your K/P here] out of the list and it is an abomination because they [did this totally amazing thing or had this great stat] in 2017. Please understand that this list has no bearing on anything, anywhere, and getting frustrated over it will really just end up giving you heart palpitations in the long run, and no one needs that.

MRCHalifax,t3_c4xd9l,nfl,"This is inspired by an exchange in the recent thread about [which team in the conference finals is most likely to regress next year](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c4kunj/of_four_teams_that_got_to_the_conference_finals/). At one point, someone said that the Browns are more consistent at losing than the Patriots are at winning, and I thought that that was interesting enough question that I looked into it. I confess that I’m also a little inspired by the amazing [The Browns live in hell]( https://www.sbnation.com/2017/12/21/16807382/cleveland-browns-stats-chart-party) video from Jon Bois. I'll also note here that I'm using post-realignment numbers only; obviously, if you add the 11-5 Super Bowl winning campaign from the Patriots and the 7-9 season in which the Browns finished third in their division into the mix then the Browns can look even more mediocre and the Patriots look like even bigger winners. 

Fair warning: if you’re a Browns fan, this is going to hurt. I'd like to apologize to everyone who is not a Patriots fan. 

**The Question: Are the Browns more consistent at losing than the Patriots are at winning?** 

* Since realignment, the Patriots are 209-63-0 (.768). The Browns are 83-188-1 (.307), so right off the bat the Patriots are better overall at winning than the Browns are at losing. The Patriots are 34 wins ahead of the 2nd place Steelers; the difference between the Patriots and the Steelers is larger than the difference between the Steelers and the 13th place Panthers. Meanwhile, the Browns are only 13 wins behind the 31st place Raiders; the difference between the Raiders and the 30th ranked Lions is 14 wins. If the Browns suddenly, magically had 34 wins added to their total they’d tie the 24th place San Francisco 49ers. 

* The Patriots have had no losing seasons since realignment; the Browns have had two winning seasons since realignment. 

* The Patriots have been 1st in their division 15 times since realignment; the Browns have been 4th in their division 13 times since realignment.

* The Patriots have won the Super Bowl five times since realignment and have made the AFC championship game twelve times since realignment. Meanwhile Browns have had the 1st overall pick only twice since realignment (as a result of their 2016 and 2017 seasons). The Browns have earned the 2nd overall pick once, the 3rd overall pick twice, and the 4th overall pick twice, for a total of seven bottom four finishes since realignment. The Browns once went four seasons (2008 to 2011) without a top four pick; the Patriots haven’t gone more than three seasons (2008 to 2010) without a Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots are significantly better at making the final four of the season than the Browns are at having the chance to pick in the top four of the draft. 

* The Patriots have been in the top four in points scored in eleven seasons since realignment; the Browns have been in the bottom four of points scored in only ten seasons since realignment. The Patriots have been in the top four in points allowed (fewest points allowed) five times since realignment; the Browns have been in the bottom four (most points allowed) only twice since realignment. I’ll note here that the 2011 Browns had the 5th best points allowed in the league, while in 2007 the Browns had the 8th best points for in the league; the post-realignment Patriots have never been below 12th in points scored and 17th in points against. The Browns have had multiple occasions where they’re actually good in some respects, while the Patriots are never worse than mediocre. 

* The Patriots have had a positive point differential every season since realignment; the Browns have had a negative point differential in just fifteen of seventeen seasons since realignment. To go further, the Browns have finished in the bottom four in point differential five times since realignment (finishing last only three times), while the Patriots have finished in the top four for point differential eleven times since realignment (finishing first seven times). 

* The Patriots have the best point differential since realignment at +2,546; they also have the most points scored with 7,656 and fewest points against with 5,110. However, while the Browns have the fewest points scored with 4,756 they’re actually seventh last in points allowed with 6,232 and second last in point differential at -1,476 (the Raiders, at -1,540 are behind the Browns). The Patriots therefore are 1,070 points better at being good over time than the Browns are at being bad over time; I'll note here that only the Steelers (at +1,282) and the Packers (at 1,059) join the Patriots in having a point differential since realignment over +1,000. 

* A note in favor of the Browns being more consistent or the two teams being equally consistent: the Browns made the playoffs once since realignment, whereas the Patriots have missed the playoffs twice since realignment. However, this is impacted by the oddity of the Patriots missing the playoffs at 11-5 in 2008 and the Browns missing the playoffs at 10-6 in 2007. As such, I feel that this isn't something that should necessarily be held against the Patriots as consistent winners or for the Browns as consistent losers. 

I'll confess to having cherry-picked some numbers in there, and I welcome anyone who wants to use different metrics to attribute success to the Patriots and lack of success to the Browns in order to show the Browns as being more consistent than the Patriots. **Having said that, for better or for worse, in my opinion the Patriots have shown that they're more consistently good since realignment than the Browns are consistently bad.** There's simply too much mediocrity in Cleveland and too little in New England for me to say otherwise. 

Again, my deepest apologies to fans of 31 teams, especially Cleveland. I just thought that it was interesting.",[OC] Are the Browns more consistent at losing than the Patriots are at winning?,post

&amp;#x200B;

This is a continuation of my previous [post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c3bn1o/analytics_effectiveness_of_passing_plays_by_type/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  /u/[BrockSamsonVB](https://www.reddit.com/user/BrockSamsonVB/) and /u/[Voggix](https://www.reddit.com/user/Voggix/) pointed out how my meta analysis might benefit from a deeper dive into game situations.  We decided to use WP or winning percentage as a filter for game situations.  I created several cases:

* WP between 0.2 and 0.8
* WP between 0.4 and 0.6
* WP below 0.2
* WP above 0.8

The chart is NOT much to look at, but I think it is best that we get the full context here.  Again, the expectation was that the Shotgun formation might become more beneficial in mid-game situations where the offense isn't forced into a desperate attempt to win the game.

&amp;#x200B;

We see that this just *isn't* the case.  In reality, the shotgun is pretty much about the same effectiveness across the board, with a slight, *slight* uptick in situations where the game is practically won.  We see EPA drop for Under Center is situations where the game is in desperation OR the offense is trying to salt the game away.  This makes sense... but what doesn't make sense is that it is **STILL** better than the shotgun in these situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take this a step further and look at a ""what if"" scenario.  Obviously the gains stated here are a dream-pipe.  You may achieve gains but they'll always be lower than what is calculated here.  Still... the gains are impressive enough that even if you quartered them they'd still be something to drool over as an OC.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am talking about the right most columns.  ""Real"" is a weighted average of plays between UC/SG.  ""Optimized"" makes the assumption that we only run as many SG plays as we should, given the effectiveness differences.  That is to say, ""overall the shotgun is half as effective as under center, so it should be run half as many times as under center plays.""  The ""improvement"" column is just the percent difference between the two.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now... if you could theoretically add 37% points to your team... wouldn't you?  And even if you only got 7% more points... wouldn't you still be happy?

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is high time to re-evaluate the shotgun.  I'm not calling to remove it altogether (that's *insane!),* but it is certainly dominating the playcalling without showing results.",Analytics - Theory: Teams can increase their scoring potential by running less Shotgun formation,post

&amp;#x200B;

Here we look at the big impact challenge plays that were upheld.

&amp;#x200B;

* [10/21/2018 CHI - NE (:02) (Shotgun) M.Trubisky pass deep middle to K.White to NE 1 for 54 yards (D.Harmon). The Replay Official reviewed the short of the goal line ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field was confirmed.](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000976755/Bears-come-1-yard-short-of-last-second-miracle-vs-Pats)  
Trubisky heaved the ball an impressive 60 yards and it was caught... only problem is that it was a few yards shy and White was unable to work his way through multiple defenders.  Prior the play the Bears were clinging to a less than 0.01% chance of winning the game.  Had they converted it likely would have gone to overtime and their winning chances would have been much closer to 50%.
*  [11/29/2018 NO - DAL  (2:16) (No Huddle, Shotgun) D.Brees pass short right intended for A.Kamara INTERCEPTED by J.Lewis \[M.Collins\] at NO 23. J.Lewis to NO 16 for 7 yards (R.Ramczyk). The Replay Official reviewed the interception ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field stands.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5He6eqiHUI)  
Brees had the ball with plenty of time and about a 30% chance of securing the victory.  Unfortunately he wasn't able to locate his receiver and Lewis was able to snatch up his errant throw from the turf.  The Cowboys would go on to secure the victory.
* [9/30/2018 NYG - NO (4:45) E.Manning pass short left to W.Gallman to NO 47 for 4 yards (P.Williams). FUMBLES (P.Williams), RECOVERED by NO-M.Lattimore at NYG 48. M.Lattimore pushed ob at NYG 11 for 37 yards (E.Manning). Officially, a pass for -1 yard. The Replay Official reviewed the pass completion ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field stands.](https://youtu.be/xtmEIe73W2A?t=175)    
Unlike most plays, this one occurred in the 2nd Quarter.  Still it had a big impact on the game in the moment.  Prior the play the Giants were driving the ball with the lead and stood a 60.2% chance of winning the game.  This play took the chances all the way down to 39.2%.  
* [10/14/2018 MIA - CHI   (5:06) (Shotgun) K.Drake right guard to CHI 1 for no gain (A.Hicks). FUMBLES (A.Hicks), RECOVERED by CHI-E.Goldman at CHI -1. Touchback. The Replay Official reviewed the loose ball recovery ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field stands.](https://youtu.be/4PgLi24gYtk?t=712)  
It's bad to fumble.  It's even worse to fumble on the 1 yard line.  Do it in OT?  That's about as bad as you can get.  Funny thing is that Jordan Howard did this as well earlier in the game!  They went from almost assured victory back down to a 20% chance.  However, the Bears were not able to convert a FG and Drake redeemed himself by catching a pass and running the ball effectively to get them into FG range to win it.
* [12/23/2018 HOU - PHI   (2:11) (Shotgun) D.Watson pass deep left to V.Smith for 35 yards, TOUCHDOWN. The Replay Official reviewed the pass completion ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field was confirmed.](https://youtu.be/cJb0DxkJ3Dg?t=850)  
This close call sent the Texans chances of winning from 21% way up to 60.1%.  Unfortunately for them the defense wasn't able to prevent the Eagles from getting into FG position and securing the victory.
* [10/07/2018 DET - GB (10:47) S.Martin punts 39 yards to GB 13, Center-D.Muhlbach. K.King MUFFS catch, RECOVERED by DET-J.Agnew at GB 1. The Replay Official reviewed the kick touched ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field stands.](https://youtu.be/-ALi5TROViw?t=12)  
I believe this is the earlier play in the list, occurring early in the 1st Quarter.  Still it was a huge play, swinging victory likeliness more than 22% in Detroit's direction.  Funny thing is that the guy ""downed"" the ball when he could have run it in for a TD.  Didn't matter much, since the Lions scored soon after, on the very next play.  The Lions would go on to win by a comfortable 8 point lead, but the Packers definitely gifted them these 7.
* [12/09/2018 NYJ - BUF (1:54) (Shotgun) S.Darnold pass deep right to R.Anderson pushed ob at BUF 5 for 37 yards (T.White). Caught along sideline at BUF 5. The Replay Official reviewed the pass completion ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field was confirmed.](https://youtu.be/Qh6TMav8txc?t=756)	  
This miraculous catch shot the Jets odds of winning from slightly worse than a coin flip up to a better than 2 in 3 chance.  The Jets would go on to score a TD to take a 3-point lead and Josh Allen would throw the game-ending INT on the next possession.
* [12/17/2018 NO -  CAR (1:51) T.Lewis right end to CAR 1 for 4 yards (J.Bradberry). FUMBLES (J.Bradberry), ball out of bounds in End Zone, Touchback. Penalty on NO-M.Thomas, Offensive Holding, declined. The Replay Official reviewed the touchback ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field stands.](https://youtu.be/snmRTtOuyQ0?t=571)  
The Saints had a chance to put the nail in the coffin.  At 95% chances of winning the end around was fumbled out of the end zone.  Even if he had not fumbled it would have been a negative play, since there was offensive holding, but they opened the door for the Panthers.  However, the Panthers were not able to move the ball and turned it over on downs with 0:35 seconds left and securing the victory for the Saints.
* [12/15/2018 CLE - DEN (2:00) (Shotgun) B.Mayfield pass short left to D.Njoku pushed ob at DEN 10 for 5 yards (J.Simmons). The Replay Official reviewed the short of the line to gain ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field stands.](https://youtu.be/3tLW7VgjvxQ?t=658)  
A first down here would salt the clock for a victory, but ruled that he was just short and gave the Broncos a chance.  Baker Mayfield almost sucessfully drew Denver's defense offsite on the ensuing 4th and 1 play, but HC Gregg Williams called a TO and negated the possibility of the penalty.  On 4th and 1 Chubb was dropped for a loss.  Case Keenum moved the ball for a few first downs, including a 4th down conversion, but was ultimately stopped on another 4th down when he was sacked by an unblocked Jabrill Peppers.

ThatPackerFan,t3_c5czvy,nfl,"To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 29: 1948 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 17-December 19, 1948

Teams: 10

1948 NFL Draft: 330 selections (32 rounds), held in Pittsburgh, PA.

1948 First Draft Pick: Harry Gilmer, Halfback from the University of Alabama (Washington Redskins)

1948 NFL Championship Game: Philadelphia Eagles (9-2-1) defeated Chicago Cardinals (11-1-0) 7-0 at Shibe Park in Philadelphia, PA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-Plastic helmets are prohibited. This rule was enacted because critics argued that they were being used more as a weapon than protection.

\-A flexible artificial tee is permitted at the kickoff.

\-When the intended passer is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, the game clock will stop temporarily until any receivers who have gone down field have had a reasonable time to return.

\-When the offense is called for delay of game, the defense may decline the 5-yard distance penalty.

\-If a foul occurs behind the line during a backwards pass or fumble, the penalty is enforced from the spot of the pass or fumble.

\-It is illegal to bat or punch the ball while it is in a player's possession.

\-All officials are equipped with whistles, not horns.

During the season, Halfback Fred Gehrke painted horns on the Los Angeles Rams' helmets, making the first modern helmet emblem in pro football. The last regular season game played on Wednesday until the 2012 season happened on September 22, 1948, between Detroit and Los Angeles.

In the Eastern race, the Eagles beat Washington 45–0 in Week 5 to take a 1/2 game lead. When the 6–1–1 Eagles met the 6–2 Redskins again in Week 10, Washington lost a must-win game, 42–21.

The other race was all Chicago, as the Cardinals and Bears both had records of 10–1 going into the final week. A record crowd of 51,283 packed Wrigley Field on December 12 to watch. The Bears took a 21–10 lead, on George Gulyanic's touchdown as the 4th quarter began. Charley Trippi's touchdown cut the margin to 21–17, but the Bears had the ball and time on their side. The turning point came when the Cards' Vince Banonis picked off a pass from Johnny Lujack,  and ran the ball back to the Bears' 19, and Elmer Angsman scored the winning touchdown three plays later for the Western Division title and the trip to the championship.

The 1948 NFL Championship Game was a rematch from the previous season between the Philadelphia Eagles and the defending champion Chicago Cardinals, this time however the game took place in Philadelphia. Coming into the game, the Cardinals were favored by 3 1/2 points, despite being the road team. The 1948 NFL Championship was significant as it was the first to be [televised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuZAO1wHFw) (ABC).

The game (also known as the Philly Blizzard) was played in Philadelphia during a significant snowstorm. Bert Bell, the NFL commissioner (and former Eagles owner), had considered postponing the game, but the players for both teams wanted to play the game. The snow began at daybreak and by kickoff the accumulation was 4 inches (10 cm) at a temperature of 27 °F (−3 °C). The paid attendance for the game was 36,309, but the actual turnout at Shibe Park was 28,864.

It was a scoreless game until early in the 4th quarter when, after Chicago had fumbled in their own end of the field, the Eagles recovered the fumble that set up Steve Van Buren's 5-yard touchdown at 1:05 into the quarter. The game ended with the Eagles deep in Chicago territory. Eagles head coach Greasy Neale gave a majority of the credit for the win to veteran quarterback Tommy Thompson.

This game was the Cardinals' last appearance in any NFL Championship game for over 60 years, until Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009. Ironically, the Cardinals had to beat the Eagles in the NFC Championship that season to advance to the Super Bowl.

This game remains the 2nd lowest scoring postseason game in NFL history, eclipsed only by the Dallas Cowboys' 5-0 win over the Detroit Lions in 1970.

Flopcandy,t3_c4s9q6,nfl,"##Intro- there is a conclusion/tl;dr at the bottom for those that want it. Important parts are bolded throughout the way.

A few minutes ago (now an hour and a half ago), I saw [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c4ozq2/dak_prescott_no_ceiling_on_what_team_and_i_can_do/erxnom8/) about a hypothetical triple doink, and that got me thinking: endless doinks is probably the most likely way a ball could come to rest on the crossbar, so what would happen if this were to actually happen?

&amp;nbsp;

##Definitions and Examples

First, we need some definitions, [from the official NFL rulebook, Rule 3, Section 11 and Rule 11, Section 3.](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2018-nfl-rulebook/)

* **Field goal (FG):** A Field Goal is made by kicking the ball from the field of play through the plane of the opponents’ Goal. **The entire ball must go through the plane.**

* **Plane of the opponents’ Goal:** is an area either between the goal posts and above the cross bar, or, if above the goal posts, between the outside edges of the goal posts.

* **Loose ball:** a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed, or fumbled.

* **Field of play:** the rectangle formed by the Goal Lines and the Sidelines. It does not include the End Zone. (or anything past it)

* **Field:** the field of play, and the end zones. *Not* the field goalposts. Not the crossbar, not the uprights, not the stanchion etc.

We've seen some relevant FG's as examples:

* [2007 Browns @ Ravens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUmIh8GDqGU): Browns K Phil Dawson kicks a 51 yard FG. The ball hits the upright, then hits the *stanchion* (that bendy pole hooking the \|\_\| shape to the pole in the back), and then bounced back onto the field of play. This was initially ruled no good, but after review, they ruled it a made FG. The stanchion is behind the **plane**, and the entire ball passed through, and so the kick is good.

* [2018 Eagles @ Bears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BICgLiBy46o): The double doink. The ball hits the upright, and then the crossbar, and then bounces out. It is likely that *part* of the ball crossed the **plane** on at least one doink, however since the *entire* ball did not cross at any time, the kick is no good.

&amp;nbsp;

##The ball is only dead if the refs decide to blow their whistles erroneously

**If the ball is rested on the crossbar, then the entire ball does not cross the plane, so it's no good... yet. How do the refs know when/if to declare the ball dead?**  Let's gothrough the definition of a dead ball, [from the NFL rulebook, Rule 7, Section 2](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2018-nfl-rulebook/):

* **An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended if any of the subsequent conditions a-p occurs. A lot of these aren't relevant; only conditions h, i, and m might be.**

* Condition i: ""when a loose ball comes to rest anywhere in the field and no player attempts to recover it"". In this situation, the ball is a **loose ball**, as per the above definition, but it's not in the **Field**, as the field does not include the goal posts. So, this section doesn't apply here.

* **Condition m: ""when an official sounds the whistle erroneously while the ball is still in play [which it would be], the ball becomes dead immediately."" ===&gt; ""If the ball is a loose ball resulting from [i.e.] a scrimmage kick [which it is], the ball is returned to the previous spot, and the down is replayed."" Let's assume this doesn't happen, and the refs decide not to ruin the fun.**

&amp;nbsp;

* **Condition h: ""when any legal or illegal kick touches the receivers’ goal posts or crossbar, unless it scores a field goal"".**

&amp;nbsp;

**Unless it scores a field goal. The ball has yet to score a FG, but it still might! A whistle blown would be erroneous, as this ball cannot legally be declared dead otherwise.** (Again, we assume the refs decide to play this one out. But there is no standard rule in place for what to do if the ball is stationary *on the crossbar*, which is why I included condition i above.)

&amp;nbsp;

##Legal ways the ball can go in/out

But there's still one more thing: **how might this ball go in (or out)?**

* **Defensive players cannot leap up to deflect the ball**: ""[15 yard penalty:] Goaltending by a defensive player leaping up to deflect a kick as it passes above the crossbar of a goalpost. The referee may award three points for a palpably unfair act (Rule 12, Section 3, Article 4).""

* **Offensive players cannot either**: ""[For a field goal to be considered good,] After the ball is kicked, it must not touch the ground or any player of the offensive team before it passes through the goal."" (Rule 11, Section 3, Article 1)

* **No one can shake the goalposts (uprights, crossbar, etc.)**: This one's a little harder to figure out, but this is the best I could do. Rule 1, Section 3, Articles 1 and 2 talk about standard goalpost height/dimensions, and shaking the goalposts would lead to improper goalpost metrics, which wouldn't be a fair field goal.

* **No one can throw anything at the ball/goalposts**: I don't remember exactly which rule it was, but I believe it relates to the above- the side that throws the objects would have interfered with the kick, and it would be a penalty.

**That leaves... the wind. There is *nothing* that bars wind assistance during a field goal. In fact, basically all field goals have some wind assistance even if it's unnecessary. The word ""wind"" isn't even in the rulebook.**

&amp;nbsp;

##Conclusion/Tl;dr

So, in conclusion. 

* The refs can blow the play dead at any time, and if they do, the kicking team tries the FG again.

* If they don't, only the wind will decide the fate of the ball, and we would all expect to see the entire stadium blowing at the ball to try and sway it one way or the other.

* However, I would imagine that they'd blow it dead after 10-20 seconds, simply because it would be ridiculous to just leave it there (unnecessary delays, changing momentum of the game, etc. Maybe viewers would tune out and lower revenue idk)

Over the next month, I’m going to be unveiling the best team of all time comprised solely of players drafted at that spot. We’re going to determine which draft pick, historically speaking, could yield the best team. The criteria for who I can and cannot put on that team is listed in the introductory post; remember that if a great player from the 1960s is not on this list, odds are that he got drafted twice (once by the NFL and once by the AFL) and I put him on another team that needed him more.

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the #1 team of all time comprised solely of #32 picks.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses**

**Strengths:** This offense is really, really good. Drew Brees at quarterback is about as good as it gets, and he’s got some great options to throw the ball to. Henry Ellard is a borderline Hall of Fame receiver, Dave Parks was one of the league’s top tight ends throughout the 1960s, and while the running game isn’t great, the offensive line is loaded with talent. St. Clair is a Hall of Famer, Wistert probably should be a Hall of Famer, Mankins was one of the top guards of his era, Krisher has received multiple accolades throughout his career, and Donaldson started 228 games and made six Pro Bowls. Brees is going to have all day to throw against some of the weaker defensive lines.

**Weaknesses:** However, this defense is really, really bad. For a lot of these positions (linebacker and secondary in particular), a lot of this was just filling the numbers. With the exception of Fred Smerlas at nose tackle, there’s not a single player on this defense that is very noteworthy for some of the top offenses in the league. The defensive line isn’t strong, the linebackers might be the worst yet (the three of them combined for no All Pros and no Pro Bowls), and the secondary could be better.

**VOTING STARTS TOMORROW**

Well, we’ve done it. We’ve gone through all 32 teams, representing each pick in the first round, and picked out the all-time roster for each of them. It’s been a fun journey, and I’m glad that you guys have enjoyed this series. It’s been a blast to put together, and hopefully you guys found the concept as creative as I did.

But, we’re not done yet. Because now, it’s time for you guys to vote on the best team.

Here’s how it’ll work. Starting tomorrow, I’ll post the links for voting. The bracket is fairly straightforward- it’s single elimination where 1 plays 32, 2 plays 31, etc., and the winner moves on to the next round. By next week, we’ll have a definitive answer from you guys as to which draft spot has netted the best team of all-time players.

Here’s a look at the schedule as described in the introductory post:

- **Tuesday, June 25:** Round of 32 Voting (part one- I’ll post eight of the 16 matchups tomorrow so that you guys aren’t voting on 16 matchups at the same time)

- **Wednesday, June 26:** Round of 32 Voting (part two)

- **Thursday, June 27:** Sweet 16 Voting

- **Friday, June 28:** Elite Eight Voting

- **Saturday, June 29:** Final Four Voting

- **Sunday, June 30:** Championship Voting

This means that on the first day of July, exactly one week from today, we’ll know which draft picks put together the best team of all-time. If you ever need any refreshers as to what the teams look like, the hub has every single team and the link to every single post. Voting will be as simple as filling out a Google Doc, and I’m restricting it to one vote per person for obvious reasons.

This series has come out to 160 pages on Microsoft Word, single spaced (each one is about five pages), and over 75,000 words. I’ve put in the work for the makeup of the teams. But now, I’m stepping back. Starting tomorrow, you guys are in control of this series.

Bmotley,t3_c4uhel,nfl,"After seeing u/jaguargator9’s series of teams based on draft picks, and the contest about to begin; I decided to create a team based on the best undrafted players at this position. I thought this would be a fun experiment, seeing how those 1st round picks teams did. The advantage this team has is depth of choice, while u/jaguargator9 had limited options per team, whereas around ¼ of the NFL players currently are undrafted. To rank, I will be using PFR’s Weighted AV system, HOF considerations, and All-Pros/Pro Bowls, I wanted a rather even way to determine who would make the team, and I felt that was the best option. So without further ado…

NFL ALL-UNDRAFTED TEAM

**Offense:**

**QB: Warren Moon**
A nine-time Pro Bowler, with 49,325 career passing yards, 291 TDs, and 7.2 Y/A, and a 58.4% completion rating, AV of 119, 80.9 Passer Rating, and a HOFer; not to mention a prolific CFL career. He played for four teams in his career and a total of 208 games. This makes Moon an excellent choice for this team. 
	Runners Up: Kurt Warner/Tony Romo

**HB: Joe Perry**
A prolific runner and receiver, from a time where that wasn’t common, a HOF member, 3x Pro-Bowler, 2x All-Pro,  9,723 Rushing Yards, 5.0 Y/A, 2,021 Receiving Yards, 7.8 Y/R, 83 Total TDs. 

**HB: Priest Holmes**
A running back who had short, but stellar prime exploding defenses playing in KC. This 3x All-Pro, 3x Pro-Bowler was unstoppable both rushing and receiving in the game for three straight years. His career ended thanks to age and injury, and who knows what would have happened if he had played more in Baltimore. He ended his career with an AV of 84, 8,172 Rushing Yards, 4.6 Y/A, 3,962 Receiving Yards, 8.7 Y/R, and 94 total TDs.
	Runners Up: Marion Motley (FB)/Arian Foster (RB)

**WR: Rod Smith**
Rod Smith was always a consistent, reliable receiver, with a few breakout seasons in his career. He was always overshadowed by the greats, but shouldn’t be discounted. With 2 Super Bowl rings, and 3 Pro Bowls, he’s a worthy addition to this list. With 849 Rec, 11,389 Yards, 13.4 Y/R, and 68 TDs, he’s a great addition to this team.

**WR: Wes Welker**
What undrafted list would be complete without Wes Welker? Making his name in the slot, he made it to five Pro Bowls, a 2x All-Pro, and played with two of the greatest QBs in the game, ~~Nick Foles and Joey Hartington~~ Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. His 9,924 Receiving yards, 11 Y/R, and 50 TDs mean this team is set in the slot.
	Runner Up: Wayne Chrebet

**TE: Antonio Gates**
Still in the NFL, Gates looks like he's on his way to the HOF, being an 8x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 11,841 Yards, and 116 TDs. You’re not going wrong with Gates at TE.
	Runner Up: Jack Doyle

**OT: Lou Groza**
HOF, 9x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, and 4x NFL Champ


**OT: Jason Peters**
9x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, and 1x Super Bowl Champ


**OG: Larry Little**
HOF, 5x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, and 2x Super Bowl Champ


**OG: Jim Langer**
HOF, 6x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, and 2x Super Bowl Champ


**C: Jeff Saturday:**
6x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, and 1x Super Bowl Champ


Defense:


**DE: Cameron Wake**
A 5x Pro Bowler and 1x All-Pro, Wake made a name for himself on the Dolphins, getting to the passer. He’s sacked the QB 98 times, and forced 22 Fumbles


**DE: Coy Bacon**
Thanks to sacks and forced fumbles not being recorded until after Bacon’s retirement, we’re going to have to go on AV and reputation, he was a menace off the line, and consistent, playing 180 games. He was also a 3x Pro-Bowler.
Runner-Up: Michael Bennett


**DT: John Randle**
Pretty obvious one here, HOFer, 7x Pro Bowler, and 6x All-Pro. This man destroyed offenses with 137.5 Sacks, 29 FF, and 471 Solo Tackles, playing 219 games.


**DT: Bill Willis**
Another old school player, but a HOFer, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and 1x NFL Champ. Anyone who makes the HOF is a worthy player to this team.


**LB: James Harrison**
Again an obvious choice that should be included in any undrafted team, Harrison was a menace to offenses, with 84.5 Sacks, 34 FF, and 573 Solo Tackles. 5x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, 2 Super Bowl Winner, and 2008 DPOY.


**LB: London Fletcher**
A top tackler, Fletcher made 4 Pro Bowls and won a Super Bowl in his career. With 1380 Solo Tackles, 39 Sacks, and 19 FF, a good center fielder to wrap up the offense.


**LB: Jessie Tuggle**
Another fine tackler and consistent defender, Tuggle made 5 Pro Bowls, had 1640 Solo Tackles,  21 Sacks, 10 FF, and played 209 games.


**S: Emlen Tunnell**
Nicknamed “The Gremlin” Tunnel was no doubt one of the best to play at his position, with 79 Ints, 4 TDs, he made it to 9 Pro Bowls, and was a 4x All-Pro, and 2x NFL Champ. 


**S: Willie Wood**
Another HOFer, Wood had 48 Ints and 2 TDs, as well as being an 8x Pro-Bowler, and 5x All-Pro. On top of that, he won 2 Super Bowls, and 5 NFL Championships.


**CB: Dick “Night Train” Lane**
A man who needs no introduction, Lane was one of the best DBs in NFL history. 68 Picks, 5Tds, 7x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and a HOFer.


**CB: Willie Brown**
Yet another HOFer in the secondary, Brown was a 9x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, and 1x Super Bowl Champ. He had 54 Ints, and 2 TDs in his career.


**Strengths:** This team is loaded plain and simple, but the secondary is the best by far with 4 HOFers. The Offensive line is no slouch either with 3 HOFers, and of course Moon at QB will lift up that offense.


**Weaknesses:** Weaknesses on this team has to be at WR, both options are decent for sure, but nothing compared to the rest of this team, with no HOFers among them. The DL is solid, but edge rush isn’t as good as the interior. No big play makers at LB besides Harrison, Fletcher and Tuggle are good, but are Tacklers, not playmakers.",All Undrafted Team,post

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|

|Saints|Buccaneers|Jets|~~Falcons~~|
|Bills|Raiders|Chargers|~~Cowboys~~|

ZappaOMatic,t3_c4jexx,nfl,"Bit of a late night quickie history lesson after stumbling across [it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/readjack/status/1143029828418965504), but I thought this story was hilarious and had to share it here as well.

In the 1940s and 50s, George Connor was one of the early great Bears linebackers.  But he had to earn his place, getting hazed and beaten up by his teammates until he earned a spot on the roster.  Despite this, perhaps the craziest beatings he saw and got were not from other players, but Green Bay Packer fans?

Yeah, thought the rivalry was already wild?

As explained in [Robert Markus' column in the December 16, 1967 edition](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33189355/) of the *Chicago Tribune*:

&gt; THE ROUGHEST and meanest games, of course, were the ones against the Green Bay Packers.  If present-day Bear fans think there's a bitter rivalry between the teams, they haven't seen anything, says Connor.

&gt; ""When we'd go to Green Bay they used to hire bands to play outside our hotel rooms all night,"" Connor reminisced.

&gt; ""There used to be two or three thousand Packer fans to meet us at the train station just to look at the hated Bears.  One time after we beat the Packers a fan walked up to George Halas and punched him in the face.""

&gt; Another time the Bears were playing the Packers in the old Green Bay stadium and Connor was blocking downfield.  He couldn't find anyone to hit except Indian Jack Jacobs, who was already down and trying to get up.  Connor decided to keep him pinned down and, ""Jacobs kicked me right in the chin and opened up a cut that took 13 stitches to close.  In those days we didn't have a physician who'd travel with the team.  I think Halas hired a veterinarian.  I had to go out of the stadium to a little shack they had there and this guy sewed me up with a crooked needle that looked like a fish hook.

&gt; ""When I tried to get back in the stadium there was a Packer fan manning the gate and he wouldn't let me in.  ""But I have to play,' I told him.  'Tough,' he said.  There were a couple of Bear fans way up in the top of the stands and they came down and started a fight with this guy and I got in.

&gt; Then the Packer fans started beating me over the head with programs, lunch bags, anything they could get their hands on.  I finally jumped the fence and ran across the field to our side and Halas said to me. 'You're late, that will cost you 25 bucks.'""

&gt; IF YOU HAVEN'T YET gotten the idea that Connor was a pretty tough cookie himself, perhaps you don't remember another Bear-Packer game, in 1955, we think it was.  The Bears kicked off to the Packers and the hall was taken by Veryl Switzer, who had built a pretty fair reputation for himself at Kansas State.

&gt; Switzer charged straight up the field like a maddened bull and Connor charged straight down the field like a railroad locomotive. The twain met somewhere in the vicinity of the Packer 30 and the resultant collision registered on every seismograph in the state of California.  Switzer and Connor went one way and the football the other.

&gt; The next time the Bears kicked off, Switzer again caught the ball, took one look at Connor thundering down on him again and lateraled to a teammate.","During a Bears/Packers game in the 40s, Bears LB George Connor left the stadium to treat an injury. When he tried to get back in, a Packer fan blocked him and got in a fight with Bear fans. As he returned to his sideline, Connor was attacked by more GB fans and fined by George Halas for being late.",post

RCJH_supersonics,t3_c4r0xt,nfl,"I was compiling all of the Seahawks losses since Russell Wilson was drafted prior to the 2012 season (don’t ask). Anyways I noticed that since he came into the league, the Seahawks have only lost by double digits four times in RW’s career:

2015 Week 2: Packers 27-17

2016 Week 14: Packers 38-10

2016 Divisional Round: Falcons 36-20

2017 Week 15: Rams 42-7 (I was there, big yikes)

I am not sure how other quarterbacks stack up here. But for a completely useless stat I think it’s pretty impressive that the RW has only been beaten by 10+ points four times in 7 years, including the postseason. Not to mention it didn’t happen at all until Russell’s 4th season in the league. 

I think it’s relevant stat for him considering the success he’s had in he 4th quarter and second half of games particularly in the latter years of his career so far. He keeps his team in games better than arguably any QB in the league rn. 

Anyways I realize this is peak offseason stuff here but this little stat definitely struck me.

EDIT: I realize this is more of a Seahawks stat than a RW stat. I should’ve reflected that more but I think it’s worth pointing out the Seattle defense has not been the same since 2016. Russell Wilson shattered the 4th quarter touchdown pass record in 2017 and it was mostly a product of being behind going into the the second half of games. I would argue there were games that played out the same way in 2018.",Interesting Russell Wilson/Seahawks statistic,post

To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 28: 1947 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 21-December 28, 1947

Teams: 10

1947 NFL Draft: 330 selections (32 rounds), held in New York City, New York.

1947 First Draft Pick: Bob Fenimore, Running Back from Oklahoma State University (Chicago Bears)

1947 NFL Championship Game: Chicago Cardinals (9-3-0) defeated Philadelphia Eagles (8-4-0) 28-21 at Comiskey Park in Chicago, IL.

This season featured the following rule changes:

 \-A fifth official, the Back Judge, is added to the officiating crew.

\-When a team has fewer than 11 players on the field prior to a snap or kick, the officials are not to notify them.

\-An illegal use of hands penalty will be called whenever a defensive player uses them to block the vision of a receiver during any pass behind the offensive team's line.

\-During an unsuccessful extra point attempt, the play becomes dead as soon as failure is evident.

\-Roughing the kicker will not be called if he kicks after recovering a loose ball or fumble on the play.

\-All teams are required to use prescribed standard yardage chains, down boxes, and flexible shaft markers.

\-Games are no longer played on Tuesdays.

Starting in 1947, the NFL teams played a 12-game schedule rather than 11 games. The twelfth game proved to be crucial for the Steelers, Eagles, Cardinals and Bears. In the Eastern Division, Pittsburgh took a half-game lead over Philadelphia after a 35–24 win in Week 5. On November 30, the Eagles won the rematch, 21–0, to take a 7–3–0 to 7–4–0 lead. The same day, the Cardinals lost to the Giants, 35–31, while the Bears beat Detroit 34–14; the 7–3–0 Cards were a game behind the 8–2–0 Bears in the Western Division.

In Week 12, the Cardinals beat the Eagles, 45–21. Pittsburgh beat Boston 17–7, while the Bears lost to the Rams, 17–14. The result was that the Steelers finished at 8–4, and the 7–4 Eagles had to win their last game. The Cardinals and Bears were both at 8–3, and the Western title would go to the winner of their December 14 season-closer. A crowd of 48,632 turned out at Wrigley Field to watch. The Cardinals won the game, 30–21, and the right to host the championship. The same day, Philadelphia beat Green Bay, 28–14, to force a playoff with Pittsburgh.

This division playoff game, the Steelers' sole postseason appearance until 1972, was played on December 21 at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. The winner would travel to Chicago to play in the championship game the following week to face the Cardinals. Originally scheduled for December 21, the playoff pushed the title game to December 28. Philadelphia scored a touchdown in each of the first 3 quarters, while the Steelers never got on the board. The 21-0 shutout sent the Eagles to the title game.

In the 1947 NFL Championship Game, both the Cardinals and Eagles were making their first appearance in a title game. The Cardinals had won the previous match up between these teams just 3 weeks earlier, winning 45-21. This would be the only NFL championship game played at Comiskey Park.

To start the game, the Cardinals scored on a 44-yard run by Charley Trippi to take an early 7-0 lead. During the 2nd quarter, Elmer Angsman took a 70-yard run to the house and gave the Cardinals a 14-0 lead in the game. The Eagles would respond with a 53-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tommy Thompson to McHugh to cut the score to 14-7 at the half. In the 2nd half, Trippi would return a punt 75 yards for a touchdown giving the Cardinals a 21-7 lead, however the Eagles answered when Steve Van Buren ran a 1-yard touchdown in to make it 21-14. The 4th quarter began with another 70-yard touchdown run by Angsman, giving the Cardinals a 28-14 lead. The Eagles would respond with about 5 minutes left in the game on a 1-yard run by Russ Craft, making the score 28-21. Any hope of an Eagles comeback was dashed when the Cardinals executed an extended drive to take the remaining time off the clock and clinch their first NFL title.

This championship win by the Cardinals still stands today as their only NFL championship, the longest drought without a title for any NFL franchise that is active as of today. Both the Cardinals and the Eagles would meet up again in the 1948 NFL Championship Game, but a different result would occur.

Galaedrid,t3_c4xy1m,nfl,"Was having a convo with a friend earlier and we were talking about decisions teams have made in the past which didn't seem like a big deal at the time, but turned out to profoundly change the direction of the team.

&amp;nbsp;

For instance I was arguing that the Bills not letting Flutie play had a huge impact on their fortunes that they may still be seeing the effects of. While he was arguing that choosing to play Brady over Drew had a bigger impact. I disagree because in my mind it was more a forced decision by Mo Lewis and Brady got his chance and showed his stuff, whereas Flutie had already shown his stuff and that he could win but was benched anyway. No one forced the team to bench Flutie. Had the Bills stuck with the hot player, who knows how many rings they might have now.

&amp;nbsp;

So anyways, its the off-season and I was trying to think up other high impact team decisions that totally turned around a teams fortunes either good or bad. I was thinking maybe letting Marty go was one, but I guess that didn't have too much of an impact, only a few years of Norv. Ditka trading all his draft picks for Ricky Williams comes to mind as well, but again that didn't really effect the team all that much (at least if memory serves me correctly). Sucking for Luck seems like it should be one, but hasn't been so far.

i predict drew lock to be the best QB. sure it will take a couple years, but long term I believe he will pan out. he’s a very smart player, and low risk. he has a very high ceiling and his playstyle will fit very well with the broncos, not to mention he will mention for a season or two under flacco. i see high potential in him.",Hidden Gems in 2019 draft,post

In some cases, like the number 3 pick, there really isn't a clear player, while in others, like the number 16 pick, it was pretty easy to choose.

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.

#New Tribe

The Fantasy Football Conference has arrived. In a draft, all three conferences autopicked their teams, and already, the FFC is claiming they are going to the championship game. It may be devastating to them when they find out there are no waiver claims, and injuries start to stack on their team.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|FFC|Eliminated|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Saints|Buccaneers|Jets|~~Falcons~~|
|Bills|Raiders|Cardinals|~~Cowboys~~|
|Colts|Redskins|Chargers|~~Lions~~|
|Bears|Titans|Dolphins|~~Packers~~|
|Giants|Bengals|Rams|~~Vikings~~|
|Browns|Broncos|49ers|~~Jaguars~~|
||Texans||~~Steelers~~|
||||~~Patriots~~|
||||~~Eagles~~|
||||~~Panthers~~|
||||~~Seahawks~~|
||||~~Chiefs~~|

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

Over the next month, I’m going to be unveiling the best team of all time comprised solely of players drafted at that spot. We’re going to determine which draft pick, historically speaking, could yield the best team. The criteria for who I can and cannot put on that team is listed in the introductory post; remember that if a great player from the 1960s is not on this list, odds are that he got drafted twice (once by the NFL and once by the AFL) and I put him on another team that needed him more.

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the #1 team of all time comprised solely of #31 picks.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses**

**Strengths:** Find the weak spot in the linebacker unit. It’s almost impossible. Al Wilson, Bill Bergey, and Bill Forester are all really solid options at linebacker, and the three players have combined for 13 Pro Bowl appearances between them. Additionally, the receiving options are really good; McDonald is a Hall of Fame player, and the other three players to throw the ball to are, at worst, in the Hall of Very Good. There’s some quality offensive weapons on this team, as well as a front seven with a strong linebacker unit and a really strong defensive tackle combination, including a Hall of Fame player in Curley Culp.

**Weaknesses:** The offensive tackles have a combined two years of experience between them. If this list was made in October 2019, there’s a very solid chance that Kaleb McGary would be on here. The interior of the line is not bad by any means whatsoever, but the outside of the line is abysmal, and might be one of the worst ones yet. The secondary has its highlights with Cromwell (a member of an all-decade team) and Asomugha (one of the top cornerbacks in the league at his peak). However, while there are strong points in the secondary, the weak points are really bad, and certain elements of this secondary may get exposed fairly easily.

**/r/NFL Poll Question of the Day**

You guys are eventually going to vote on the bracket and which team advances in each round. However, to get you guys engaged during this month-long process when I’m going through the teams, I’m going to do a simple Strawpoll question a day regarding the roster makeup of the team in question. Because today’s post is about the team of #31 draft picks, today’s question will be about the receiving controversy on this team.

**All four receiving threats on this team are quality players that have made it to multiple Pro Bowls. These players are Todd Heap, Tommy McDonald, Greg Olsen, and Carl Pickens. Of these four players, who is the top receiving option listed here?**

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18212301)**

**Final Thoughts**

There are some really good things about this team; in particular, the linebackers are really strong, and there are four solid options to throw the ball to. However, the offensive line poses major question marks, especially at the tackle position; against some of the better defensive ends in this tournament, they could get destroyed and might not be able to get anything going. That weakness might be enough to keep them from doing anything major in this tournament, but that will be up for you guys to decide in just a few days.

We’ll do the team of #32 picks tomorrow at 9:00 ET, as well as reveal what the tournament is going to look like. **Starting on Tuesday, you guys get to vote on the greatest team of all-time from these draft picks.** I’ll go over everything in tomorrow’s post.
