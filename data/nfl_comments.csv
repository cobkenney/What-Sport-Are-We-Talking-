syedshazeb,et88trf,t3_ca74h3,nfl,"Wolfhard has been a busy guy outside of Stranger Things. In fact, he’s one of the main reasons why pop culture is obsessed with kid-centric horror fare set in the 1980s. In addition to the hit Netflix series, he’s also lent his talents to the IT franchise, the second chapter of which is releasing later this year.

That said, the young actor’s forthcoming resume is actually stacked with offerings that will continue to see him explore the darker side of entertainment. In October, he’ll voice Pugsley Addams in the animated The Addams Family feature. Then, in 2020, he’ll get his teeth sunk into a modernized remake of The Turn of the Screw titled The Turning, followed by the highly-anticipated sequel Ghostbusters 2020. All in all, Wolfhard is on his way to becoming a bankable horror star.

----

The rankers shat up the process, don't get me wrong, but it was doomed from the start.

No deterministic voter aggregation system is perfect. That's Arrow's impossibility theorem. In brief, Arrow's theorem proves that no system can satisfy all of the following requirements simultaneously:

1. The system is deterministic (randomness is not involved).
2. The system has no dictator (there is not one preselected person who decides the list on their own).
3. The system is monotonic. Someone moving Joel Bitonio up in their rankings can never negatively affect his overall ranking.
4. The system's rankings are independent of irrelevant alternatives. If the mechanism computes that Carr &gt; Foles, someone's last minute re-ranking of Bitonio (leaving their relative order of Carr and Foles the same) should not suddenly flip the aggregate result to Foles &gt; Carr.

The mechanism used here to aggregate votes is a poor adaptation of a Borda count. How does the Borda Count interact Arrow's Theorem? It's easy to verify that the first three axioms are satisfied; only the last one has problems. Namely, moving a lineman between Carr and Foles ""pads"" the gap between them, which may (fairly or unfairly) affect their relative ranking. What did the rankers go out of their way to do? Mix up the rankings of various positions.

That's right. They took the Borda count, fucked it up, then went out of their way to hammer in on its one major weakness.
Then the politics started, and the rest is history.",comment

Coming out his biggest strengths were straight line speed, coachability, play-action, and ability to avoid the rush. 

His weaknesses: Average at processing information, Average accuracy, fumbles a lot, misses obvious blitzes, doesn't anticipate throws well and is missing zip on the ball.

I feel like he's a guy a lot of people are rooting for despite knowing he's a bubble-starter.

prof_talc,et75aos,t3_ca8vit,nfl,"Imo the Vikings probably bear some culpability for Korey’s death, at least morally, but I think you are mischaracterizing his widow’s legal case. It was pretty weak on the merits. For example, “very powerful NFL lawyers” did not get immunity for the trainers. The trainers were immunized by default under MN employment law. The fact that Korey’s widow went after them individually was a stretch, as evidenced by the fact that the summary judgment against her was upheld twice. Also, the Vikings were investigated and cleared by MN OSHA. 

If anyone is curious about the employment law/workers’ comp angle, here’s a link to the MN Supreme Court decision. Interestingly, the great Alan Page was on the MN Supreme Court when this case was argued. He recused himself, but it would be interesting to know his thoughts!

Turns out, that was not his first interception return for a TD. Five years earlier, on Thanksgiving in 1998, he did this against Troy Aikman. Adams spent the first six seasons of his career with the Seahawks, with this being his most notable play in that stretch. However, it wouldn’t end up mattering; after Seattle took a 14-13 lead after this pick, Dallas scored 17 straight unanswered points, and ended up winning 30-22.

However, this was the play that put the Jets on the board on their opening drive of the second half.

Jedi-Master-Kenobi,et72woa,t3_ca7nsb,nfl,"We had the same team on defense. Although if you made Tippet a DL, you could have a better secondary.

1 Ty Law

2 Andre Tippet

3 Tedy Bruschi

4 Asante Samuel

5 Fred Marion

6 Larry Eisenhauer

7 Nick Buoniconti

Offense I disagree with. Give me Aaron Hernandez over Morris. In the 5th take Marcus Cannon. Hernandez is a better TE than Coates and far more versatile. 7 on 7 you need versatility and hybrid players. Leaving Hernandez off at the cost of a 1960s undersized lineman is really questionable. Hernandez was utilized as FB/TB/TE/Slot WR. He is too valuable of a player to be left off. Pats need a big OL to handle the big boys up front and Cannon is 335. Morris is 250 and Hannah is 270. 

1 John Hannah

2 Rob Gronkowski

3 Curtis Martin

4 Aaron Hernandez (or James White)

5 Marcus Cannon

6 Tom Brady

7 Julian Edelman or Troy Brown",comment
bwredsox34,et74gbi,t3_ca7nsb,nfl,"Just a follow up now that I'm on my computer instead of my phone, but this was my list:  
    **(1) OL:** Hannah  
    **(2) TE:** Gronkowski  
    **(3) HB:** Martin  
    **(4) OL:** Morris  
    **(5) TE:** Coates  
    **(6) QB:** Brady  
    **(7) WR:** Edelman   
    **(1) DB:** Haynes  
    **(2) LB:** Tippett  
    **(3) LB:** Bruschi  
    **(4) DE:** Flowers  
    **(5) DB:** Marion   
    **(6) DE:** Eisenhauer  
    **(13) LB:** Buoniconti  
  
To build off u/JaguarGator9 in saying you have to slot in necessary Fall of Famers I think Haynes has to make it as your 1st round selection for the defense. Seymour is good (and should be in the Hall of Fame some day, but Haynes gives you 5 definitive Hall of Famers (7 when Brady and Gronkowski eventually make it in).
    
I had Larry Eisenhauer on my list as well, but had no idea who he was so I did a little research. And by did a little research I mean I read his Wikipedia page...here's an interesting tidbit:  
&gt;He was nicknamed ""Wildman"" by his Patriot teammates because of his unpredictable antics, such as running out onto Kansas City's snow-covered Municipal Stadium field clad in only his helmet and athletic supporter, hitting his head on metal locker doors or ramming his forearms through locker room walls to motivate himself.  
  
If that's not a sign of the kind of player you want taking the field for a pickup game then I don't know what is haha.  
  
On offense everything was pretty spot on. I would take Edelman over Brown but you can't go wrong with either. Edelman has put up better stats in less time and has better playoff production. Ultimately too I think he has a better connection with Brady and in a hypothetical 7v7 matchup I want Brady throwing to Edelman, especially with all the open space on the field. If teams can't stop Brady and Edelman on third down with 11 defenders how in the world will they do it with 7?!  
  
One final point, really glad that u/JaguarGator9 included Nick Buoniconti here. He was an amazing player and guy, and while more so known for his time with he Dolphins including playing on their undefeated team, he absolutely contributed to and played a significant role with the Patriots before that. If anyone likes sports documentaries I highly recommend watching [The Many Lives of Nick Buoniconti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_nDyZMvN-0)  
  
**EDIT** Absolutely thought Ninkovich was drafted by the Saints but his rights were traded to Pats during the draft, didn't realize at all that he spent two years with Miami first after the Saints as well. Since that's the case I still think you have to take Haynes, which moves Flowers in as the 4th round pick and Marion as the 5th round pick. My mistake!",comment

It’s just a simple check-down play that should result in a modest gain just short of the first down line; instead, Smith somehow turns it into an 86-yard gain. At one point, I counted five Cardinal defenders in the same frame (including a swarm of 3-4 defenders who got the opportunity to lay a hand on him), and yet, Smith broke free of all of them for the long gain. Even the ref got bulldozed over later on in the play. Dallas would go on and win the game 20-15, and would later win their fourth Super Bowl at the end of the year.

&gt;The Dolphins selected Wilkins, a 6-foot-3, 315-pound defensive tackle, with the No. 13 pick in April's NFL draft with eyes on him being a cornerstone of their rebuild. Miami hopes Wilkins will make an on-field impact comparable to that of the Tennessee Titans' Jurrell Casey. But what makes Wilkins unique is the package that comes with the player.

&gt;Wilkins, 23, dances, sings, cooks, jokes, backflips and moonlights as a substitute teacher.

&gt;He did a smooth split and gave Swinney a wet willy on national TV after Clemson won its national titles.

&gt;Wilkins gave NFL commissioner Roger Goodell a flying shoulder bump on stage after he was drafted.

&gt;He's a natural leader and a team captain. His personality lights up every room, and he's unapologetically frolicsome.

&gt;""I'm completely happy being myself. A lot of people spend their lives trying to be something else. With all the social media, everybody wants instant gratification,"" Wilkins said. ""Everybody wants to be like this person or that person. Everybody wants to have a certain amount of followers or likes.

Jurph,et7nis9,t3_ca7anl,nfl,"Ravens/Patriots, a playoff game from some time in the last five years or so. Brady appeared to be doing an audible. I had seen him use a fake audible to set up an RB direct snap and I yelled at the TV ""it's a fake!"" right as the ball went to the RB. Someone on the Ravens defense had seen it before as well, and they blew up the play for a loss. That play goes for 5-7 yards any other day, converts the 1st, and probably turns into a score, but the Ravens stuffed it.

I give Revis a *slight* edge over Bailey. When Revis entered the league, the new DPI rules had been implemented that didn’t allow any room for contact in the secondary. With these restrictions, he still came into the league by storm and became the first true shutdown corner of the “passing explosion” era. Hard to really pick one or the other.",comment

Maad-Dog,et74ybg,t3_ca7t2b,nfl,"If we're strictly talking prime, than I'd rather have 2018 Kittle than any Jimmy Graham season. But obv if we're trying to get more 2010s representation than one great year, I can see why you'd go Graham, but if you go Kittle at least you can get similar blocking at the TE position to what Gronk will provide on the other side.

In reference to your hard questions, if we're talking prime, def Graham &gt; Olsen and OBJ &gt; Fitz.

Also I'd agree with the other guy who said we should actually use RTs, where Lane Johnson could represent the NFC and Mitchell Schwartz could represent the AFC.

Also on defense, I think there has to be a difference between edge rushing LBs and off ball LBs.  The AFC just has a shit ton of edge rushers with Von and Suggs, and only Derrick as an off ball, while the NFC is more balanced with 3 off ball linebackers.  I think you got to include AFC guys like (holy shit the AFC has had no dominant off ball LBs) CJ Mosley and Darius Leonard if you're fine with 1 year primes, otherwise Dont'a Hightower or Telvin Smith?

For your hard DE question for the NFC, I think it's p hard, but Peppers/Allen peaked in the 2000s rather than in the 2010s imo.  I think I'd go Cameron Jordan and Calais Campbell.

And again for NFC LB, if we're going prime, you gotta go Patrick Willis no doubt.

For NFC returner, like you mentioned I almost wanna go Hester over Patterson because he's a punt returner as well, Patterson just does kick returns.

Overall I feel like the offenses are pretty well matched, Gronk is the biggest mismatch that gives the edge to the AFC.  Defense AFC has the edge, NFC has the interior, LBs, and safeties.  Coaching goes to AFC, hard to decide, could go either way.",comment

Sturdevant,et7zo85,t3_ca7265,nfl,"2004 Panthers. Started 1-7, then finished the season 7-9 with the only losses being a returning Michael Vick in overtime at Atlanta. Panthers had them beat, but Vick levitated into the endzone on a 4th and goal to tie the game up in the last minute. Second was the true heartbreaker bc had the Panthers won, they were in the playoffs (from what I remember), but came out flat against New Orleans and the season ending on a blocked game-tying fg (which was like 59 yards anyway). Had Carolina won that game and made it in, some noise would have been made.

**Edit:** Was off about Vick, that was his healthy season after breaking his leg. They were 11-3 going into that game, which furthers my belief.",comment

James was the 80s version of Darren Sproles, and in 1985, had 86 receptions for 1,027 yards and six touchdowns, with this arguably being the best of those receptions.

And #36 on the Raiders (the guy who had his ankles combust trying to get to James here)? He wouldn't play for another five weeks after this game, and that was the last start of his NFL career.

Dahki,et5534t,t3_c9z8m8,nfl,"2013 Hawks easily the most stacked team. Pulled off an unreal draft with a rookie contract QB and one of the best defenses this decade.

Then I'm gonna say 2014 pats and 2016 pats are a tie for me. 2016 offense was better, 2014 defense was better. Both great teams by the time the bowl rolled around, but not as good as the 2013 hawks imo.

Then i'll go 2010 packers. They're a bit weird for me because it takes a special team to never have a deficit of more than 7, but to constantly be in striking distance and still end up losing 6 games leaves a few wins on the table. I want to put them higher and lower simultaneously, so here's probably a good place.

2015 Broncos. That defense could damn near win games by themselves and they sure didnt lose them any games. Peyton lost his arm but he was still a good enough field general to beat a lot of teams.

2017 Eagles. BDN just scary. Too many playmakers to account for. I'm not sure any of the other superbowl winners this decade could've pulled it off after losing their starter.

2012 Ravens. I don't remember fuck all about this team.

2018 Pats. Honestly felt like the pats won the super bowl this year in the same way Peyton Manning used to win MVPs. No clear best team/player or its a close race between a few different teams/players? Eh fuck it, Peytons in there somewhere, give it to him.

* Only team in NFL history to never be down by more than 7 points in a season- something they did for all 20 reg sames + playoffs.

* Finished 3rd in NYPA for *and* 3rd against.

&amp;#x200B;

In games that mattered including post season they were 16-2, with wins over the Vikings(13-3), Patriots(13-3), Rams(11-5), Panthers(11-5), Falcons(11-5), Chargers(9-7) and Cowboys(9-7).

&amp;#x200B;

Their 3 losses were to:

&amp;#x200B;

The Chiefs(10-6) during the Chiefs 5-0 start.

The Seahawks(9-7) on the road.

The Cowboys(9-7) in a game they lost 6-0 because they played backups against starters. 

&amp;#x200B;

And they blew teams out. Their point differential? 162. The exact same as the 2017 Pats, and the dominant squad of 2016 Pats only had 190 despite an extra win to do it. To put in context, the #2 seed Vikings had a PD of 130.

&amp;#x200B;

2012 Ravens are criminally underrated. Their playoff run includes victories agains the 11-5 Colts, Arguably the best Manning-led Denver team in Denver, and the Patriots in foxborough.

Im sure someone will give me grief for picking '15 Broncos at #2. Well they beat the Patriots in the playoffs, who won a superbowl the year prior and would win the next year.

Giants- No answer at QB. They are one of the best in the league at running and run stopping- but who cares about that in 2019? Many problems on both offense and defense. I still like Shurmur, but I expect he gets fired after this year. Not really his fault, the blame lies with Gettleman and the past Giants FO.

Buccaneers- I don't trust Jameis Winston. Arians will represent a vast improvement in their coaching staff, but their defense is still hot garbage.

JakeDaniels585,et3j043,t3_c9tq1m,nfl,"I'll say the Dolphins, Giants, Jags.

Dolphins: I have no faith in the QBs there.  Fitzpatrick is essentially a one read QB, that can thrive when he has good one on one receivers.  He's good at reading the line of scrimmage to find that match up (Did you know he wenr to Harvard /s) but he's terrible at it if the first read isn't there.  Last time he was good, had Brandon Marshall/Eric Decker before they broke down with the Jets.  Then he had Evans/Jackson/Godwin/Howard/Humphries.  The Dolphins don't have that luxury, so offense will struggle, especially with a bad O-line.  

Normally I don't like to guarantee against second year QBs with potential because they can be such wildcards.  A good step forward from them, and it's a whole new ball game, which is why Bills, Jets aren't here.  However, Rosen is a bad fit for an offense with terrible OL as we found out last year.  The weapons aren't great, and I don't think that's going to be a harmonious QB room.  Fitzpatrick deludes himself into thinking he's a great option (Called out Todd Bowles after being benched for throwing 6 ints, and like 11 passes that should have been intercepted), while Rosen fancies himself as a franchise guy.  In fact, in some ways I see similarities between them.  Look great one game, horrible the next.  

Throw in the lack of talent elsewhere to overcome QB issues, and this is pretty much a guarantee.  

Giants: Eli Manning, Daniel Jones, and no OBJ.  

Reminds me of the 90's Lions.  Sanders running around to make plays but everything else doesn't add up.  

Jags:  I hate their offense.  I don't understand the fascination with Foles for them, especially with these weapons.  

I think the Colts, Texans, Titans are better set up. The franchise is set up in a way where they need a young cheap QB to be a savior, and they went completely the opposite.",comment

Will Kitchens be a good HC? Will Mayfield play as well as last year? What's going to happen if they start out slow? 

They've, no doubt, improved a lot in some areas. But, the AFC North is still a tough division. The Steelers likely will be a better team, and the Bengals may prove more dangerous than we think. Defenses have to prove they can stop Lamar Jackson.

JaguarGator9,et30mle,t3_c9un23,nfl,"For the record, the referees ruled this a touchdown; this was the only kickoff return for a TD in Kauffman’s career. However, when I was watching this play, something definitely felt off. I thought he prematurely dropped the ball before reaching the end zone. So, I was able to slow it down and take a screenshot the moment the ball left his hands. Turns out, this TD definitely shouldn’t have happened, as this was definitely a fumble by Kauffman before reaching the end zone.

**[Image 1](https://imgur.com/gbCrCwp)**

**[Image 2](https://imgur.com/DPzGN7z)**

Back in 1995, there was no instant replay, so there was no way for the referees to review the play. Having said that, there’s no way that this should’ve stood as a touchdown. In the end, this is completely meaningless, though; the Raiders won the game by more than one score (and this kickoff return was early in the first quarter), the Raiders missed the playoffs, and the Colts made the AFC Championship.

In the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Graddy won the gold medal in the 4x100m relay, and won the silver medal in the 100m. As an NFL player, his career was not so good; he only caught 18 passes, and was known for dropping lots of passes. He scored three receiving touchdowns in his career, with this being the first one in the first quarter.

There were nine turnovers in this game, with this definitely being the most bizarre. Darryll Lewis had one interception in 1991, and it was this one, which came after teammate Cris Dishman batted down the pass with his shoulder. Lewis took the ball off of his shoulder and took it 33 yards to the house. Houston ended up winning this game 17-13.

And we can’t forget Cameron Artis-Payne as a decent back with veteran leadership.

Sks44,esywmcg,t3_c9ihpy,nfl,"My Mom has had three strokes. They are awful and I wouldn’t wish them on anyone. If you think someone might be having one, remember the acronym FAST:

F= Facial Drooping. People having a stroke will often have their mouths or eyes on one side relax and not move.

A= Arm Weakness. People suddenly are super weak and can’t really lift or move their arms. Some people also will have pins and needles feeling all up their arms and hands.

S= Speech Difficulty. People having strokes will slur their speech, have difficult pronouncing words, etc... Sometimes they will speak nonsense but not always. When my Mom had her first stroke, she got angry with my brother because she was “fine”. Her speech was slurred but she was angry he called 9-11 since her house was messy and she didn’t want the paramedics seeing it.

T= Time to go to hospital. If you have any question, go. The sooner they start getting help, the better chance they will be able to make it so the stroke’s effects are limited. 

**FAST**

One thing I read also stated that, if you think someone is having a stroke, keep talking calmly to them even if they aren’t responding well. Also, touch them. If you have a blanket or something else soft in the area, rub it on their bare skin and ask them if it feels okay. The idea being that you are stimulating parts of their brain and keeping those parts active might help it so the stroke doesn’t fully destroy them.

terrypatrick,eszd8lv,t3_c9klwg,nfl,"Always thought the shade Kiper and others put on his athletic ability didn’t make sense in context of evaluating his potential ability to play QB

Like in Brady 6 Doc, Kiper says “he had a horrible 40, he had a horrible vertical jump”.

It always made me scratch my head why *those* things were important in evaluating a QB.  I get part of it is just seeing how “athletic” they are, etc.....but the 40 &amp; VJeeg aren’t really things that matter to playing NFL QB (think Brady said something like that in the doc right after Kiper....like “those aren’t my strong suits, but fortunately you don’t really need those to play QB”)

I think part of it (specifically regarding TB) is Kiper/scouts going back to those poor showings at combine to justify why/how he was missed til 199, etc....and part of it is so much of “good/great QB” really is that “it factor” intangible that’s just really hard to quantify.

Like Brady looked goofy af doing 3-cone at the combine....but he’s one of the best at moving in a 3’x3’ box in games, sliding around to avoid the rush/get an open throwing lane/waiting just that split second longer to let receivers clear coverage/etc.

Same with Manning and Brees.  That insane ability to feel pressure with their eyes downfield &amp; just slide or move in the pocket.  It’s incredible.

Anyway, kind of rambled there....but it’s *that* kind of movement that seems to actually matter for NFL QBs, not 40 or VJ...but at the same time that kind of pocket presence and movement isn’t quantifiable like 40/VJ/3-cone and even if it was measurable in a drill, it’s more of a “Yeah, but can they do that in a real game?”....and I guess that circles back around to the “it factor”/“intangibles”",comment

We live 2 1/2 hours away, but she's took time out of her busy ass life (she's about to get her own radio show in a college town if her idea gets approved) to come spend time with me.

We've always been close, but I think something changed when I took care of her after her abortion (not going to get into the details of that), cause she like really looks up to me since.

But the more I think about it, she's always followed my lead in a lot of ways: when I got into fitness, she did, I was a hardcore Marco Rubio supporter in the primaries, and she voted in the primaries for the first time ever.

Spyroexe,et4zh7d,t3_c9wg7y,nfl,"Some of you might call me a nephew for saying this but it was actually the Colts-Giants game from last year. I had known about football before and I’d watched plenty Super Bowls but I was never a more-than-casual fan.

I had gone to two games before this one. The first was a 2011 preseason game against I think the Redskins. Similarly to the regular season, the Colts played like a pile of hot garbage. But it was still fun, and the first time I ever went to Lucas Oil Stadium.

The second time was a regular season game during the 2017 season and it was so bad I forgot who we were playing against. I didn’t follow football well back then and I just coasted the popular opinion at school that the Colts suck. Needless to say, that game didn’t change my perception of the team’s quality. My family left after the third quarter.

Now, back to last year. My dad got some tickets to the game from his job and took us out. Based off my previous two experiences, I wasn’t expecting much. I was somewhat proven right when in the second quarter we were down 14-0, and I was already asking my parents to leave early (a dick move in retrospect). We still trailed 14-7 into halftime and I figured that the Colts would do what I’ve known them to do best, which was continue to suck.

However, the second half proved me wrong. After what seemed like a tennis match with back and forth touchdowns and field goals, the Colts finally took the lead at 28-27 with about a minute to go. I knew if the Giants got in FG range they would win, so me and my family hung onto the edge of our seats.

That’s when Eli Manning does what *he* does best: throw an interception.

We won a close game, and the comeback taught me to stay in the game until it’s over. It was nice to actually be at a game where we won instead of get blown out by shitty teams. That night, I found out we were one win from returning to the playoffs for the first time in a few years, and the win we got that day gave us our first winning season in the exact same time span. I followed the Colts for the rest of their season and also checked out some other teams. I learned how much strategy actually goes into the game, which made it more appealing to me personally, and watched several highlights videos from YouTube. All of this happened in such a short time span and got me into the game of football and the NFL.",comment

JaguarGator9,esxcgyq,t3_c9f86o,nfl,"Behold what might be the coldest take of all-time. 

In 1994, FOX took over the rights to the NFC package from CBS, and this article was talking about their first week and evaluating how they did. There were some positives and negatives, but perhaps the biggest negative that was talked about was the score bug. Apparently, according to writer Dan Cox, having the score bug was a horrible idea. From the article:

“The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game.

“Fox Sports president David Hill has said it’s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.

“Well, yes. But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.”

Prior to 1994, there was no score bug. The score and time remaining would just pop up on the screen every so often. But, with FOX coming onto the scene, they decided to have a [score bug in the upper left corner](https://streamable.com/aldbn). And apparently, this writer thought that was a bad thing.

Imagine a game in 2019 where there’s no score bug and no running clock. The score bug has become an essential part of the viewing experience. Unless you’re keeping track with a stopwatch at home, you can’t tell how much time is left without it. And unless you’ve been watching the game the entire time, you wouldn’t know what the score is without the score bug.

If you proposed that a network remove their score bug in 2019 and refuse to show any score whatsoever, you’d get laughed out of the building. It’s a take that has aged laughably bad.

**TL;DR: Someone’s take was that “showing the score during games is bad.""**",comment

2000 (Couch), picked 1.1:

* Chad Pennington, 1.18, Jets
* **Spergon Wynn, 6.183, Browns**

2005 (Dilfer/Frye), picked 1.3 and 2.34:

* Aaron Rodgers, 1.24, Packers
* Jason Campbell, 1.25, Washington
* **Charlie Frye, 3.67, Browns**
* Ryan Fitzpatrick, 7.250, Rams

2006 (Frye/Anderson), picked 1.13 and 2.34:

* Tarvaris Jackson, 2.64, Vikings
* Bruce Gradkowski, 6.194, Bucs

2007 (Anderson/Frye), picked 1.3 and 1.22:

* **Brady Quinn, 1.22, Browns**
* Drew Stanton, 2.43, Lions

2008 (Anderson/Dorsey/Quinn), first picked at 4.104, but traded down from 2.56:

* Chad Henne, 2.57, Dolphins

2009 (Quinn/Anderson), first picked at 1.21, but traded down from 1.5 via 1.17:

* Mark Sanchez, 1.5, Jets
* Josh Freeman, 1.17, Bucs

2010 (McCoy/Delhomme/Wallace), picked 1.7:

* Tim Tebow, 1.25, Broncos
* Jimmy Clausen, 2.48, Panthers
* **Colt McCoy, 3.85, Browns**

2011 (McCoy/Wallace), first picked 1.21, but traded down from 1.6:

* Jake Locker, 1.8, Titans
* Blaine Gabbert, 1.10, Jaguars
* Christian Ponder, 1.12, Vikings
* Andy Dalton, 2.35, Bengals
* Colin Kaepernick, 2.36, 49ers
* Tyrod Taylor, 6.180, Ravens

2012 (Weeden), picked 1.3 and 1.22:

* Ryan Tannehill, 1.8, Dolphins
* **Brandon Weeden, 1.22, Browns**
* Russell Wilson, 3.75, Seahawks
* Nick Foles, 3.88, Eagles
* Kirk Cousins, 4.102

2013 (Campbell/Weeden/Hoyer), picked 1.6:

* Geno Smith, 2.39, Jets

2014 (Hoyer/Manziel/Shaw), picked 1.8 and 1.22 and 2.35:

* **Johnny Manziel, 1.22, Browns**
* Teddy Bridgewater, 1.32, Vikings
* Derek Carr, 2.36, Raiders
* Jimmy Garoppolo, 2.62, Patriots
* AJ McCarron, 5.164, Bengals

2015 (McCown/Manziel/Davis), picked 1.12 and 1.19:

* Trevor Siemian, 7.250, Broncos

2016 (Kessler/McCown/RG3), picked 1.15 (via 1.2):

* Carson Wentz, 1.2, Eagles
* Jacoby Brissett, 3.91, Patriots
* **Cody Kessler, 3.93, Browns**
* Dak Prescott, 4.135, Cowboys

2017 (Kizer/Hogan), picked 1.1:

* Deshaun Watson, 1.12, Texans
* **DeShone Kizer, 2.52, Browns**

2018 (Mayfield), picked 1.1:

* **Baker Mayfield, 1.1, Browns**
* Sam Darnold, 1.2, Jets
* Josh Allen, 1.7, Bills
* Josh Rosen, 1.10, Cardinals
* Lamar Jackson, 1.32, Ravens

This list is not intended to shit on the Browns. They passed on Brady, Brees, and Wilson -- but so did everyone else. Only Big Ben, Rodgers, and (potentially) Wentz/Garoppolo/the 2017 guys really stand out as fuck-ups; and as we always say when this comes up, it's tough to argue those guys would be great had they ended up on the Browns during those dark times. The big misses in 2017 are justified by finally getting their guy in 2018 after adding great pieces elsewhere in 2017.

I think 2012 is the only year they can be faulted for. You can say that no teams knew how good Foles/Cousins/Wilson would be, but none of those teams took Brandon Fucking Weeden in the first round.

Polamalu was just used different and was elite elite elite - but he wasn’t quite as good as Dawkins.

How the hell is Ronnie Lott not in contention here? Of the absolute top crust of safeties, I think It’s clearly a battle between Lott and Dawkins for 1 and 2. Then the reeds/polamalus/Harrison’s.

1st drive: 2-3, 19 yards, failed to convert 3rd down

2nd drive: Up 29-17, 0-1, 8 yard sack, failed to convert 3rd down

3rd drive: all handoffs 

2009 Saints: Up 17-16

1st drive: 6-8, 51 yards, failed to convert 3rd down, missed FG

2nd drive: Down 24-17, 4-7, 44 yards, int led to pick 6

3rd drive: Down 31-17, 5-7, 83 yards

2013 Seahawks: Down 43-8

1st Drive: 3-7, 25 yards, failed to convert on both 3rd and 4th down

2nd drive: 0-1, fumble, fumble lost

3rd drive: 1-1, 14 yards

2015 Panthers: Up 16-7

1st drive: 2 fumbles, 1 fumble lost

2nd drive: 1-2, 2 yards, failed to convert 3rd down

3rd drive: 3 handoffs from the Car. 4 yard line for a TD

4th drive: handoffs

So, Peyton hasn’t led a single scoring drive in a 4th quarter of a Super Bowl. I don’t count 3 handoffs from inside the 5 as a “drive he led.”

Meaning, he has more TDs thrown to the other team in the 4th than to his own. More fumbles lost than scoring drives. He has been beyond pitiful in the 4th.",comment
TDeath21,eszq2kn,t3_c9lo6s,nfl,"This needs a much much deeper dive. But it is very interesting nonetheless.

I was curious, so I looked to see how the Pats defense did during that same time. Overall, they gave up a score on 12/27 drives. 12/28 if you include a drive in which Atlanta punted to start the 4th.

The breakdown was as follows:

01: 2/3 (2 touchdowns)

03: 3/3 (3 touchdowns)

04: 1/4 (1 touchdown)

07: 2/3 (2 touchdowns)

11: 1/2 (1 touchdown)

14: 0/3

16: 0/3 (0/4 if you include the punt to start the 4th)

17: 3/3 (1 touchdown)

18: 0/3

PPD for this would be 2.66 and 2.57 if you include the Atlanta punt.

Like I said a ton more context is needed but it’s still a great thing to look at for sure.

therealmarkus7478,esytlxu,t3_c9ijf9,nfl,Isn’t this his second one?  He got one after the pro bowl or something on the plane?,comment
SaltyPane69,esyr1e6,t3_c9ijf9,nfl, Happy he’s recovering. So much bad news the past few days but it’s good he’s doing better.,comment
icewood91,esz7bc0,t3_c9ijf9,nfl,"I believe he has a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which is an opening in between the right and left atria in the heart. This is normally open while in the womb, so that the mothers oxygenated blood can bypass the lungs (because it's not like the baby is breathing, so theres little point to take all the blood there) and go to the systemic circulation. Typically it closes shortly after birth, but if it stays open fairly regularly (about 25% of people). 

Usually it's not an issue, but what can happen is that a blood clot that would normally just go to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism goes through the open PFO and up to the brain. This is called a paradoxical embolism. Usually, you don't close the PFO surgically as most people don't have anything bad happen, even after getting a stroke they usually just manage it medically with anticoagulants and such. However, since he's had two now, I would think that the chance of them closing it would be higher, especially if he has been taking medication.

Good news however, as his family characterized it as a TIA, which is a transient ischemic attack. The key word is transient, as you get symptoms and then they go away because the ischemia (or disruption of blood flow) cleared up on its own. You still want to rush to the hospital and make sure an actual stroke isn't eminent, since typically TIAs precede the real deal and long lasting effects. 


I can't say for sure, since I am by no means a neurologist (nor, Dr. Chao on twitter), just a 4th year medical student, but hopefully Tedy makes a full recovery.  I always see these kinds of stories, like Kelly Stafford's acoustic neuroma, and try to dive deeper into what exactly is going on medically, so hopefully this helps people understand what he's going through from a very, very surface level. 

Again, I have literally no idea what his actual prognosis and diagnoses are, this is just applying what I've learned to what I can gather from the IG post and news stories about his PFO.",comment

RussellManiac,et0j1rm,t3_c9ijf9,nfl,"Back in February, as my work day was ending, my right side started feeling numb.  I didn't really have any other typical symptoms of a stroke.  

I'm 55.  The next day, my right side was number than it had been when I went to bed.  I've since been to the hospital ER twice, and numerous doctor visits.  Multiple MRI's and Cat Scans.  No stroke was found, however it's likely I suffered a very small stroke.

The problem is, since then I've had other issues as well.  I've missed so much work I've lost my job.  I can't type as well as I used to, nor really even write at all legibly anymore.  

It's not something that goes away.  I knew this from my mom having strokes as well.",comment
DaLyricalMiracleWhip,eszly8m,t3_c9ijf9,nfl,"Friendly pitch to keep a list of the medications you’re taking (and a list of your allergies) in your wallet / purse. There are medications (namely blood thinners) that have a huge role in the decision-making process surrounding stroke care, and limiting the time it takes to sort them out decreases the time your brain is infarcting in front of everyone’s eyes.",comment
