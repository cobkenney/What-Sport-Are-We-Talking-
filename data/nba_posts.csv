#""Must Bookmark"" Reddit pages for the offseason. 

1. Please visit /u/MrMittenz fantastic [2019-20 NBA Free Agents and Team Roster Tracker](/c28033). This has every team's current signees and roster holes in a very easy to read format. His page is a *must bookmark* for the offseason.

2. /u/Perksofthesewalls (and moderator of /r/warriors and /r/nba) has taken over the reins of the [FAQ on NBA Free Agency: 2019 Edition](/c7714k). This is an excellent resource to get to know what new rules and constraints your favorite teams are operating under.

3. /u/FlynnPatrick has a excellent summary of the relatively difficult to track [List of All Undrafted Player Deals So Far](/c3ejdo). 

4. /u/zandrickellison has five fantastic summaries of prospective under-the-radar free agents:

*  [99 cent store free agents: Point Guards](/c1n06q)
*  [99 cent store free agents: Shooting Guards](/c2gkb8)
*  [99 cent store free agents: Small Forwards](/c3q2y3)

rjnk68,t3_ca8b1q,nba,"A lot of debate over the last couple days over Russell Westbrook's value in a potential trade. It almost feels like most people are premeditating/assuming a serious or long term injury to Westbrook over the next 4 years because of his style of play as opposed to him actually being injured. 

John Wall is injured right now yes, and will likely be out till December-January next season. Chris Paul has shown himself to be injury-prone for most of his career and is 34 years old so yes there's a likelihood you could expect miss to miss maybe 15-20 games next season. Steph Curry has missed 50 games in the last 4 seasons, while Kyrie Irving has missed 76 (regular season). Westbrook has only missed 14 games in the last 4 seasons. 

Russell Westbrook is 30 years old right now, and likely has 2-3 years of all-NBA level play left in him. He elevates any team he goes to. I get that the Zach Lowe's of the world have been preaching about the low value of Westbrook's contract, but I mean, good luck finding an injury-free 27-9-10 all-NBA level player around the league that's available.",Russell Westbrook is averaging 27-9-10 over the last 5 seasons.

MantisTobogganMD2,t3_cacn1j,nba,"I've noticed a trend, oftentimes, when there is a player for whom impact stats/analytics vary greatly from the conventional wisdom of casual fans, they're a player that either gets to the line a ton, or fails to do so.

**Imagine Klay Thompson shooting 75% last season from 3 on his same amount of attempts. That's the value Harden provides from the FT line.**

Now, let me backtrack and show you how I got there.

Getting a shooting foul is the most valuable shot an offensive player can get. For an 80% FT shooter, that's an expected 1.6 pts per possession. If you crank it up to an elite 90% FT shooter, it's 1.8. Even if a guy only shoots 70% from the line, the EV of his free throws are still 1.4. Compare that to other types of shots. If you're getting to the rim, an 80% free throw shooter would have to convert at the rim 80% of the time for their layup attempt to be more valuable than free throws. On a 3 pointer, it's almost equally impossible to surpass the value of FT attempts. 45% from 3, which is incredible, is an expected 1.35 pts per possession, so equivalent to a 67.5% FT shooter. Point of all this being, it's essentially impossible to get off higher EV shots from the field than 2 FT attempts from a 70%+ FT shooter.

All this ties into my title because fans don't seem to value getting to the line as much as they value other attributes. It seems like almost all casual fans thinks guys who consistently make difficult contested shots from 2 (be they layups or mid-rangers) or guys who drain from 3, are better than those who can get to the line consistently. This makes sense, as it's a much more exciting play, and it feels like the player is doing more, but it's absolutely incorrect from a value to winning perspective.

Let's connect this to players for whom impact stats and other analytics differ in value from fan perception.

Klay Thompson: 2.0 FTA per game

D'Angelo Russell: 2.5 FTA per game

CJ McCollum: 2.7 FTA per game.

Mike Conley: 5.8 FTA per game.

Danillo Gallinari: 6.0 FTA per game.

James Harden: 11 FTA (!!!) per game.

I think most fans here would consider D'Angelo Russell and Mike Conley to be somewhat similar in terms of value, but analytics indicate they're not even remotely close. Free throw attempts is a great explanation for why that difference in perception exists. Russell shoots 78% from the line and gets there 2.5 times per game, that's 1.95 pts per game from the line. Conley shoots 84.5% on 5.8 attempts, which is 4.9 pts per game from the line. So that's an extra 3 pts per game from free throws alone. That might not sound like a lot, but it's a ton in terms of value. Picture a guy hitting an extra 82 3's per season on the exact same amount of attempts, and that's the difference in value here.

Put another way, Kyrie Irving shot 40% from 3 last year, if he increased his value provided from 3 pt attempts by the same amount as the difference in value between Conley's and Russell's pts from the FT line, he'd be a 59% 3 pt shooter. So the gap in value between Russell and Conley from the line is the same as the gap in value between what Kyrie Irving did last year, and what he hypothetically would have done had he shot 59% from 3, which everyone probably would have made him MVP.

To do another comparison, Harden added 8 extra pts from the line as compared to Klay Thompson last year. For fun with this same line of thinking, if Klay wanted to recoup that extra value Harden provides from the line on 3 pointers, he'd have to shoot 75% from 3 on his 7.7 3PA per game.

None of this even factors in the fact that drawing fouls knocks opposing players out of game when they get in foul trouble or foul out, or that racking up fouls gets the whole team in the bonus quicker.

More context/reasoning:

&gt;With 3 guys so good at dribble penetration on the floor at the same time, the defense is going to have to rotate down when the ball gets to the middle, and it's just a question of finding Shamet in the corner and giving him an accurate pass.

He didn't say how many attempts per game but I interpret high-volume as at least 5. Do you agree/disagree with Coach Nick? I think it's too bold personally.

ergotpoisoning,t3_ca6q0p,nba,"[I did this a few years ago ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/84xd1f/misery_vs_happiness_fanbase_rankings_oc/)and after the enormous upheaval of the past few weeks I think it's time to take another look. Bear in mind these are all just my opinion, and that I'm an idiot and I forget tons of shit all the time. I'm just bored at work.   

***

**TIER 1 aka ""Somebody pinch me"":** 

**1. LA Clippers** \- I mean you just pulled off what most people were saying was impossible, and although it cost you a ton of picks you didn't have to gut the team. Set up to contend for the next 4 years, and *even better* it came at the expense of the Lakers.

 *** 

**TIER 2 aka ""Man this off-season was so close to being perfect"" :** 

**2. Brooklyn Nets** \- You did it, you got your two stars and like the Clippers you plucked them from right under your big brother's nose. The only issue here is that KD got injured so this season is probably not one where you're gonna contend. Still, what a massive vote of confidence in the Nets operation.

**3. LA Lakers** \- AD is a Laker, and the roster around him isn't a disaster. Getting two-timed by Kawhi has gotta sting but there are at least competent NBA players around your star duo so you should definitely be a contender regardless.  

***  

**TIER 3 aka ""Kawhi has gone omg"" :** 

**4. Philadelphia 76ers** \- Jimmy and Reddick are gone but most people would argue you got better. With Kawhi going West it now looks a lot like a two-horse race in the East, and Horford might be a huge addition.

**5. Milwaukee Bucks** \- Brogdon left, but there is a decent chance a trade is in the works to reinforce the guard spots. You have the MVP, a great shot at making the Finals, and the reigning Executive/Coach of the Year. Bucks making the Finals looks like at the worst a 50/50 outcome.

**6. Toronto Raptors** \- Bittersweet maybe, but that title is going to go down in legend. It will still be a lot of fun watching Siakham blossom into (hopefully) a proper All-Star this year, and the books are totally clean after this season. Excited to see what Masai and Nurse cook up.  

***  


**TIER 4 aka ""Funny how things turn out huh"" :** 

**7. New Orleans Pelicans** \- Things were looking pretty bleak there for a while, but the AD haul was substantial and then you won the lottery. Now you've got all those Lakers youngsters, Zion, a bunch of picks, and some smart free agent signings. Making the playoffs this year could be tough given how stacked the West is, but it doesn't feel like the wait will be long.  

***  


**TIER 5 aka ""I can almost talk myself into thinking we're a contender"" :**    

**8. Utah Jazz** \- Some big moves needed to happen, and your front office made them. Mitchell will be a year older, Conley is a great addition, and Gobert is still a beast. So long as Conley stays healthy I'd be feeling good about my chances against anyone so long as the young players keep developing.

**9. Denver Nuggets** \- Jokic kicked ass in his first playoff outing, and you committed major money to Murray. Hopefully everyone kicks on from last season and Jokic cements himself as a top 5 player. The hope is you'll be a more complete team with better health than the Lakers, and maybe you can leverage that into another great regular season.

**10. Houston Rockets** \- The Warriors are gone, and you could make an argument that the Rockets are now the best team in the West because it's only really the Warriors who have been able to stop them. It must also be gratifying that all the talk of locker-room turmoil amounted to nothing. Still, CP3 is probably going to decline every year, so the window (if it still exists) is closing all the time.

**11. Portland Trailblazers** \- I actually like the Whiteside addition a lot because he fits with how your defense works perfectly. Losing wing depth is tough in this league, but it's still exciting to think about how this revamped team will look. Dame also solidified his claim to having the biggest balls in the league, and then doubled down on committing to your team other stars be damned. That's cool as hell.   

***

**TIER 6 aka ""Let's just see how this looks then I'll get back to you"" :** 

**12. Indiana Pacers** \- Oladipo will be back, you got Brogdon, Collison retired, Bogdanovic and Young left. What a weird mixed bag of an off-season. Still, you were excellent last season and Turner was getting into the DPOY conversation. If he takes another leap and Brogdon is worth his contract, you should be be a top 4 seed in the East again.

**13. Boston Celtics** \- Losing Kyrie was probably a blessing rather than a curse by the end, and replacing him with Kemba at least ensures that you'll still field an All-Star at PG. Losing Horford and Baynes hurts though, because it's tough to see how the defense doesn't take a step back. Still, Tatum and Brown will still develop, you got rid of Toxic Terry, and Hayward will hopefully be better another year removed from his injury.

**14. Dallas Mavericks** \- This had all the makings of a Tier 4 team along with the Pelicans, but then everyone in Dallas sat on their hands instead of adding talent around your young stars. The key here obviously is Porzingis looking like his old self - if he does you'll be a hugely exciting young team with playoff aspirations and a big future; if he doesn't then you're hoping it's fun watching Luka develop while KP works back towards being fully fit.  

***

**TIER 7 aka ""Well that could have gone worse I guess"" :** 

**15. Golden State Warriors** \- Losing KD and Klay to injury was awful, losing KD to the Nets was salt in the wound. Still, getting what will be regarded around the league as a big asset back means that you can reconfigure the roster going forward if the Russell/Curry backcourt doesn't bear fruit. Keeping Looney helps a lot too.

**16. San Antonio Spurs** \- Last year was always going to be odd with so many departures, but I think Dejounte being out masked how good of a team you still are. Smart off-season pickups and I think you'll end up like last year's Clippers - a far better and more cohesive team than people expect, and a nightmare Round 1 matchup in the playoffs.  

***

**TIER 8 aka ""We're gonna be fun to watch at least"" :** 

**17. Atlanta Hawks** \- I think this is a really smart rebuild. I like the bold moves in the draft, and Trae Young is just such a great entertainer. Even with the weakened East I have difficulty seeing you as a playoff team this year, but as a Hawks fan I'd be really happy about how the front office are playing this. A few years away maybe.

**18. Sacramento Kings** \- This off-season was more of a lateral move than a definite step up. Still, last season exceeded expectations and you were most people's League Pass darlings. I'd be kinda bummed you couldn't figure out a way to have a Cousins return, but maybe Kings fans don't care.

**19. Memphis Grizzlies** \- Ja/JJJ are gonna be good, and in general I think you had a solid summer so far. It was time to part with Conley and Mark, but I think you got pretty solid value for them and I doubt you'll be out of playoff contention for too long.

**20. Orlando Magic** \- I mean you didn't make any seismic moves, but personally I think it's pretty cool that an All-Star signed a long-term contract with you rather than leaving. That's a pretty solid endorsement of where the franchise is heading. Playoffs are obviously a realistic goal again, but the real difference-maker would be Fultz at some point becoming a positive contributor. If he somehow turns his career around and becomes a competent starting point guard, you'd be in the mix for a top 4 spot.

**21. Detroit Pistons** \- Rose is a gamble, but one that I think you needed to make. This team was crying out for a dynamic ball-handling guard, and if Rose's shooting holds up I think he'll be great value. You also had limited flexibility while obviously needing to try something different, so this is probably the best you could have hoped for. I'm positive about it and I think with a healthy Blake and Rose you'll have a team capable of pulling off some shock wins when they're hot.

**22. Miami Heat** \- I mean personally I think your moves make no sense, but whatever. At least there's a star in Miami again? Thing is, you're stuck with these guys now and they're obviously not good enough to finish better than around 6th. My hope is you figure out a way to get Russ, because watching Russ and Jimmy share the ball would be hilarious.  

***

**TIER 9 aka ""I doubt we'll even be that fun, but at least there's a glimmer of hope"" :** 

**23. Chicago Bulls** \- The young guys should come on. If Lauri/Carter can play 75+ games that'd be great, and I think you drafted well. I just don't know that anyone of these guys are gonna be good enough this year to win many games. Lavine might have a fantastic season and push for an All-Star spot given how talent starved the East is, so that'll probably be the highlight.

**24. Oklahoma City Thunder** \- I mean, this had to happen at some point right? The picks probably won't be great for a while so in the next couple of years I'd be banking on SGA being a stud and trying to flip what other competent players you have into more picks. Still, although it sucks that PG ditched you at least the haul was enormous. The Clippers might well be a totally different team before they've finished their pick obligations from this trade, so those later picks might be gold.

**25. Cleveland Cavaliers** \- You're gonna be truly awful this year, but the front office seem to be making sensible decisions. Kevin Love having a good opening few months and then getting moved to a contender for some assets would help brighten the future a little. Still, probably facing a few seasons at the bottom of the pile to be honest.

**26. Phoenix Suns** \- I just wish I knew what the plan was. Weird draft decisions, weird trade decisions, weird free agent decisions. Booker and to some extent Ayton deserve better. How many more years will Booker say he's done missing the playoffs before he decides to take matters into his own hands? Still, there's just about enough raw talent here that you can't rule out a slight uptick in fortunes.

**27. Minnesota Timberwolves** \- So much of this depends on Wiggins. If he figures some stuff out you're back on track, or if you're able to move him you can at least build something different around Towns. If he's still bad and noone wants him, it looks increasingly unlikely that you'll be a Western playoff team any time soon. KAT is such an enormous talent that you have to figure out a way to maximise his early prime if you want to keep him long term. Getting Russell would have helped, so maybe there's a trade to be done there after Dec 15th.  

***

**TIER 10 aka ""I never really liked basketball anyway so this is fine"" :** 

**28. New York Knicks** \- Oof that had to hurt. It wouldn't be so bad if Dolan hadn't hyped up this summer for months, but noone even taking a look at MSG as a landing spot is a proper reality check. It's similar to the Lakers not landing Kawhi - players are showing they do give a shit about joining well-run franchises. The Nets and the Clippers did things the right way, and they usurped their neighbours as a result. Still, you did add enough competent players that bottoming out completely this year doesn't appear likely.

**29. Washington Wizards** \- No GM for the draft or free agency, and you're applying for a Disabled Player Exception for John Wall which means he's likely out for the entirety of next season. Bradley Beal says all the right things, but what is the point of him being on the Wizards? Whoever your eventual GM is they really need to work out what the hell the plan is.

**30. Charlotte Hornets** \- Landed Terry Rozier at a huge discount, got rid of the cancerous locker room presence that was Kemba Walker, and staved off interest from bigger teams in criminally underrated Nick Batum. GOAT offseason.",[OC] Fanbase Happiness Power Rankings,post

Firstly, in China, the fans of Lebron James will call him 'Old-Ja' or '30-year-old man'.  It's because we all know he used to be the 'young king', but now he is old.  People are trying to make fun just like when he made a crazy dunk or block, his fans will say 'It's not a big deal, he is just an old man'. 

Secondly, the fans of Kobe will call him 'My boss'. They think Kobe is the big brother of them. By the way, the nickname of Paul Gasol is ‘Sister in law Ga’, it's because in Chinese, the 'sol' in 'Gasol' sounds like the word which means 'sister in law'. 

The nickname of Durant is 'a little handsome boy'. That's because once some NBA fans said he is not very pretty, and lots of fans of him use Photoshop to make him look very good. So people start to call him 'a little handsome boy'.

The nickname of Steph Curry used to be 'Cute God' and that's because of his babyface. But now his nickname becomes 'the Skyf\*\*ker',  that's because when a talented player join the league, we will say:"" His limitation is the sky"". But in the past of year, Curry beat all of them, he was like saying 'Sky what?', So he got the new nickname.

Kindasucessfulbutlaz,t3_ca9mkx,nba,"Ever since trading for OPJ who’s one of the most beloved advanced stat guys in the league. The Chicago Bulls front office have been on a number crunching tare. GarPax has always been solid in the draft but have never been historically good in free agency.

The names may not be eye popping but are each some of the most interesting statistical players in the league.

With the signing of Young, Satoransky, and Kornet. 

Examples: The only players with over 800 games to average 13.5 pts, 5.9 rebs, 1.4 stls, 49% fg, and 30% 3pt are Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young. 

Sato is in elite company as one of the few players last season with at least 375 rebs, 275 assets, 75 steals, and 50 threes. Only other players to achieve that stat line in 2018-2019 are Kyrie, Fox, Dame, D’Lo, Harden, Kemba, Beal, Lowry, Bledsoe, Luka, Ingles, Jrue, Jokic, Russ, and Giannis. Sato is also a 6’7 pg and can successfully defended the 1-3 shooting 40% from 3pt range.

Kornet is a 7’1 250lbs 23 year old 3pt machine. Averaged 8.9 3pt attempts per 36 minutes. With a 4.5% shot blocking rate. The only player in the league last year to do this feat was Brook Lopez. 

As a long time Bulls fan this actually has been the most impressive free agency GarPax has ever had in their tenure. These players will have an immediate impact and won’t hinder the young starting cores projected timeline and important FA in 2021. You got to walk before you can run.

# Opening Week

**TUESDAY**

8:00 ET Los Angeles Clippers @ Toronto Raptors (TNT)

10:30 ET Los Angeles Lakers @ Golden State Warriors (TNT)

Explanation: Toronto obviously will open up on Tuesday night to raise their banner, and the only opponent the makes sense here is the Clippers so Kawhi can be with his old teammates to recieve his ring and see the banner go up. He would get a huge ovation and it would also make for an entertaining game to see the debut of the PG/Kawhi Clippers and the Raptors who are still looking to be competitive. The Lakers then would play Golden State in the second game to open up the Lebron/AD era at the brand new Chase Center in San Francisco.

**WEDNESDAY**

8:00 ET Dallas Mavericks @ New Orleans Pelicans (ESPN)

10:30 ET Utah Jazz @ Denver Nuggets (ESPN)

Explanation: The Luka/Porzingis era in Dallas and the Zion era for New Orleans would begin against each other in Zion’s home debut. Two of the most exciting young cores who might become powerhouses a few years down the line would be a great way to kick off NBA on ESPN. After this, Denver and Utah would be a good matchup to start the season off with as they are both less talked about contenders in the West who could build a potential rivalry in the coming years. It would also be Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic's debut as a member of the Jazz.

**THURSDAY**

8:00 ET Philadelphia 76ers @ Milwaukee Bucks (TNT)

10:30 ET Houston Rockets @ Los Angeles Lakers (TNT)

Explanation: Philadelphia and Milwaukee are most likely going to be in the ECF next year and this matchup also has some great storylines such as the battle for the best player in the East. For the second game, the Lakers would have their home opener against Houston in a battle of two of the top Western Conference teams. These matchups last year were always must see TV.

**FRIDAY**

8:00 ET Miami Heat @ Brooklyn Nets (ESPN)

10:30 ET Golden State Warriors @ Portland Trail Blazers (ESPN)

Explanation: The first game of the doubleheader would be the debut of Jimmy Butler (and potentially Russell Westbrook?) as a member of Miami, along with Kyrie's debut in Brooklyn. Two pretty evenly matched teams would make for some great basketball to open the Friday. After, Portland would have their home opener in a rematch of the WCF against the Warriors.

# Christmas Day

12:00 ET New Orleans Pelicans @ New York Knicks (ESPN)

3:00 ET Brooklyn Nets @ Boston Celtics (ABC)

5:30 ET Milwaukee Bucks @ Philadelphia 76ers (ABC)

8:00 ET Los Angeles Clippers @ Los Angeles Lakers (ABC/ESPN)

10:30 ET Houston Rockets @ Golden State Warriors (ESPN)

Explanation: Since it seems like tradition for the Knicks to host a Christmas Day game (even if they don’t deserve it), a perfect matchup would be against New Orleans for the Zion vs RJ storyline. To kick off the ABC tripleheader, thr much anticipated return of Kyrie’s return to Boston would be played. This would be an intense game with heavy boos from the Boston crowd, along with the storyline of the best PG in the East (Kyrie vs Kemba). For the second game of the ABC tripleheader, the two top Eastern Conference contenders would play in Philly. The storylines of this matchup would make a great Christmas game just like the opening Thursday, and this time the game would be in Philly. Then at primetime, the game that would probably become the most watched game of the year, would be the battle of LA. Paul George and Kawhi Leonard vs. LeBron James and Anthony Davis. This is a no brainer IMO. And to end the night, a rematch of 2nd round matchup and the 2018 WCF between Houston and Golden State would be played in San Francisco. I really wanted to work Denver vs Portland into this, but it seems inevitable New York gets a game so I pushed Denver vs Portland out.

# Martin Luther King Jr. Day

12:30 ET Boston Celtics @ New York Knicks (NBATV)

3:00 ET Dallas Mavericks @ Atlanta Hawks (NBATV)

5:30 ET Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies (TNT)

8:00 ET Golden State Warriors @ Philadelphia 76ers (TNT)

10:30 ET Milwaukee Bucks @ Los Angeles Lakers (TNT)

Explanation: This was the same format for last year's MLK Day, so I assume it will be the same this year. At 12:30, the Knicks hosted OKC last year, but a better matchup this year would be the Kemba led Celtics as Boston vs. New York is a good rivalry in many sports and would be a solid way to start off the day. Then, as it is a tradition in Atlanta to host an MLK Day game because of the history there, a good opponent would be the Luka led Mavs because of the Luka-Trae storylines along with both teams having two of the best young cores in the league. Then to start off the TNT tripleheader, as always the first game would be held in Memphis. An added storyline to this game would be Mike Conley's return to Memphis as a member of Utah, along with it being a matchup of the past vs. the future between Conley and Morant. Then at primetime, Golden State would visit Philly as it seems like Philly always gets an MLK Day game. Last year it was Houston vs. Philly, this year it would be Golden State. Then to finish the night, Giannis vs. LeBron would be the main storyline as the Bucks would visit Staples Center to play the Lakers.

#What each team gets

* OKC: Courtney Lee, Markelle Fultz, DJ Augustin, Chuma Okeke, 2021 second-round pick (from POR via DAL), 2023 second-round pick (from POR via DAL), 2024 first-round pick (from ORL) protected 1-8 (if not conveyed, turns into 2025 FRP protected 1-5, then 2026 FRP protected 1-3, then 2027 unprotected FRP), 2025 first-round pick (from DAL) protected 1-10 (if not conveyed, turns into 2025 and 2026 second-round picks)
* DAL: Steven Adams, Doug McDermott
* IND: Aaron Gordon
* ORL: Russell Westbrook, TJ Warren

#Why each team does it

* OKC: Trade their superstar to a better situation in Orlando, who are fresh off a playoff berth and have some promising young talent. They acquire much-needed cap relief (Lee and Augustin are expiring), a low-risk high-reward reclamation project (Fultz), and a promising young player (Okeke)
* DAL: The Mavs still have a massive TPE and need to address some roster issues. Adams provides a solid frontcourt player to pair with Porzingis. Although the contract is large, they give up Lee to partially compensate. McDermott provides a fantastic shooter.
* IND: Receives a great young player on a great contract in AG to fill in the hole at PF left by Thad Young's departure and returns Sabonis to his sixth man role, which was great for them last year.
* ORL: They acquire a top 15 player in Westbrook and fill their greatest position of need. With Westbrook, the Magic look like they can compete for a top-4 seed.

#Starting lineups after trade

* OKC: DJ Augustin, Terrance Ferguson, Abdel Nader, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel

A lineup clearly primed for a rebuild. Expect the Thunder to make additional moves, possibly to begin their own ""process"". They will have a war chest of picks even larger than Ainge's or Hinkie's, now holding 2022, 2024, and 2026 LAC firsts, 2023 and 2025 LAC firsts pick swaps, 2021 and 2023 MIA firsts, 2021 POR second, 2023 MIA second, 2024 ORL first, and 2025 DAL first.

* DAL: Seth Curry, Doug McDermott, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Steven Adams

The Mavericks have a strong frontcourt (Adams provides the rebounding KP lacks) and an excellent shooting backcourt (last season, Curry 45% and McDermott 41%). Although the west is stacked this year, this may provide the nudge Dallas needs to become a playoff team.

* IND: Malcolm Brogdon, Victor Oladipo, Jeremy Lamb, Aaron Gordon, Myles Turner

When Oladipo returns, the Pacers should have a very good lineup that can upset one of the Sixers or Bucks if things come together. They maintain some financial flexibility for the future with AG's frontloaded contract.

* ORL: Russell Westbrook, Evan Fournier, TJ Warren, Jonathan Isaac, Nikola Vucevic

This trade probably launches the Magic into that middle tier of eastern conference teams (along with IND, BKN, BOS, TOR), although it depends on how their longbois (Isaac and Bamba) progress. This should be a very good defensive team. Like IND, they have the potential to upset one of the stronger teams if things go right.","4-team trade idea: OKC, DAL, IND, ORL",post

I’d like to welcome Terry Rozier to the Charlotte Hornets… We’re pleased, we’re excited to have him on board... We feel going forward he’s going to have a big impact with our franchise. He’s going to get better and better. Nobody is going to outwork him.

We’re still in a period where we can acquire free agents and make trades. Our plan is to field a team that can be entertaining and sustained moving forward. Our goal is to compete for the playoffs, advance in the playoffs and someday win a championship.

We feel like if he was in the draft this year, Terry Rozier would have been a lottery pick.

If we reach a point where it’s clear we can advance in the playoffs, Michael [Jordan] is willing to go into the luxury tax.

We have to inject this franchise with young talented players and develop them. One of the key things [Coach Borrego and his staff] work on is player development… We do have veterans on our team [and] who plays will be determined in training camp.

I like the fact [Rozier] played four years in this league on a team that’s been successful. He’s played behind Isaiah Thomas and Kyrie Irving. He has a lot of experience and shows he deserves to be in this league.

I love that [Rozier’s] 25 years old. I love that he plays defense. He’s in the gym all the time. He’s a great worker... He’s got the physical tools.

ZandrickEllison,t3_ca94vt,nba,"Ever since the shocking news about Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, the Los Angeles Clippers have emerged as the betting favorite in Vegas to win the 2019-20 title. And they genuinely may be. They should be a great team. However, there are some signs that the hype may be *slightly* overboard based on a few factors outlined here.

**overachievement in 2018-19**

This past season, the L.A. Clippers went 48-34, an incredible record given the expectations. However, there are certain advanced stats that suggest that the ""48"" win total may have been an overachievement.

Among them: the Clippers had a +0.8 point differential on the year, which is a good mark but one that's below standard for a team in their 48-win range. To illustrate, the 49-win Boston Celtics had a +4.4 differential, the 49-win Oklahoma City Thunder were +3.4, the 48-win Indiana Pacers registered +3.3., and the 48-win San Antonio Spurs logged +1.7. 

The Western Conference is tougher than the East, but even if we make that adjustment, the Clippers overachieved. SRS (Simple Rating System) is a stat that adjusts for schedule. By that metric, the Clippers had a rating of +1.09, 13th in the NBA. Again, that falls behind teams in their win range like the Celtics (+3.9), Thunder (+3.5), Pacers (+2.8), and Spurs (+1.8).

Given all that, it's no surprise that ""expected W-L record"" claims the Clippers *should* have gone 43-39 given their advanced stat performance. Realistically, 44-45 wins feels like a reasonable outcome for last year's squad.

**a for(e)ward to this year**

The Clippers are going to trot out a wing combination of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, which may be one of the best in recent memory. I'm extremely excited to see how those two do on the defensive end; they may be the best pair of defensive wings since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.

That said, let's not underestimate the performance of the Clippers' *previous* forwards, Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari. Both are good players, who happened to have extraordinary years for the Clips last year. In the 55 games prior to his trade, Tobias Harris shot 43.4% from beyond the arc. In his 68 games played, Danilo Gallinari shot 43.3% from three himself. Those are blazing hot numbers, even when judged through the context of two good shooters (their career averages are 36.4% and 37.6%, respectively.)

Obviously, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George will be clear improvements at forward, but the question becomes a matter of: *how much?*

If you trust ESPN's ""wins added"" stat, then Kawhi + PG would have added your team +28.2 wins last year. Now, again, that comes with the caveat about the accuracy of this stat. It relies heavily on RPM, which largely feels fair but does have some outliers. The stat loved Paul George's defensive impact (+3.1 in RPM) and hasn't charted Kawhi Leonard as an elite regular season defender in some time (only +0.02 last year.) The truth is probably somewhere in between; Leonard didn't play like a shutdown defender all year long, but he's obviously a good defender anyway.

Of course, we can't simply take the Clippers win total and add +28, because we're losing two good forwards in the process. Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari would have combined for +17.4 wins last year. Overall, they're suggesting that this upgrade is good for about +10/11 wins.

Rather than debate the accuracy of these stats, the purpose is merely to suggest that the Clippers' forwards (a red-hot half-season of Tobias Harris and a healthy Danilo Gallinari) aren't anything to scoff at.

**watering down the Sweet Lou**

If you want to boil down the Clippers' surprising success last season, you can credit a few factors. However, the primary one may have been the stellar bench play of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. Williams, in particular, has thrived in his current role off the bench. The production per minute is staggering. He averaged 20.0 points and 5.4 assists in only 26.6 minutes a night.

However, it's difficult to see Williams playing the exact same role again. Effectively, he was the Clippers' lead option every minute he played. With Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, he's going to have to play some more complementary basketball.

The big concern in that regard would be whether Williams can be as effective without the ball in his hands. As a pure three point shooter and spacer, he's good but not any great shakes (36% last year, 34.9% for his career.) Where Williams truly thrives is attacking the basket. He averaged 6.5 free throw attempts per game (hitting 88% at the stripe). If he's functioning more as a third option, that number would presumably go down.

Taking the ball out of Williams' hands may also highlight his issues on defense. Last season, he graded as an atrocious defender (-3.5 on RPM). He made up with that with his offense (+3.5), but if his offensive is more limited, that may be problematic.

**buying high on superstars**

After helping to bring a title to Toronto, Kawhi Leonard's stock and reputation may be at an all-time high. Right now, a huge percentage of community members here consider him the best player in the entire NBA.

He may indeed be that -- when he's healthy.

Unfortunately, the ""when healthy"" is an important caveat. Leonard's durability concerns date back further than his load management this year, and his prior injury in San Antonio. 

Through the course of his NBA career, [Leonard has played in 73% of his regular season games](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bmxtg3/oc_unfortunately_injuries_are_part_of_the_game/?st=jxt6wmkt&amp;sh=13a1aa9e), a pace that projects to 60/82 games played per year. Even prior to his big Zaza Pachulia injury, he only played 70+ of his games 3 of his 6 seasons. Going forward, it will be interesting to see how much the Clippers can afford to manage his minutes and games in the West. Given their long-term commitment to Leonard (and their loss of picks) they would be wise to be prudent there. Projecting Leonard to play about 70 games this regular season feels like a fair over/under in that regard.

Meanwhile, Leonard's new partner in crime Paul George is also coming off a highwater mark this past year in terms of his public value. With George, I'm less concerned with his durability or shoulder issues (he's played 75+ in each of the last four seasons). However, I'm slightly concerned that we may be judging him based on a career year. This season, Paul George averaged 28.0 points per game. Prior to that, his career high was only 23.7. This season, he finished 3rd in MVP voting. Prior to that, he only cracked the MVP ballot one time (finishing 9th in 2013-14).

Now, there are a few explanations for Paul George's career year that may depend on the eye of the beholder. If you're an optimist, you'd suggest that he's fully recovered from his broken leg and firmly in his prime. If you're a pessimist, you may argue that George simply got hotter than he ever has before (especially in the beginning of the year), and may have benefited from Russell Westbrook's madcap attacking+passing ability. As always, the truth is usually somewhere in between. I expect George to be a great player again, but counting on him to have a top 3 season would be generous. In an average year, he's probably a 2nd team All-NBA player.

**overall expectations**

There are a thousand other factors that go into a ""win total"" projection that we don't have time to dig into. And some of those aren't negative at all. For example, the fact that Lou Williams can carry an offense on his own when given the opportunity actually provides the Clippers a nice safety net in the event that Kawhi Leonard or Paul George misses time. Given that, the Clippers' ""floor"" is still quite high. Even if you expect some missed time and some shooting regression, this team should easily win 50+ games.

Overall, I would pencil in 56-60 wins for this Clippers team. That's higher than some other advanced sites (FiveThirtyEight has them at 54), but lower than most fans may suggest at the moment. 

However, the Clippers fans should get excited when the lights come on and ""playoff mode"" gets activated. With extra rest between games, Kawhi Leonard should be more effective than ever, and potentially push this team over the top and to the title. That said, I would not label this a ""super team"" that's going to walk to that title. There are a bunch of very good teams in the league (particularly out West) that will have a puncher's chance to win it all themselves and aren’t far behind at all. The Clippers may still be at the top of that pack, but it's going to be a dog fight all the way through.","[OC] The L.A.

JakeLV97,t3_cadqj7,nba,"On October 27, 2012 James Harden was traded to the Houston Rockets was traded by the Oklahoma City Thunder. A trade that changed NBA History forever. Harden and the Thunder were working on a contract extension and instead of giving Harden the deal he wanted, the Thunder traded him away because they didn’t want to pay an extra five million dollars. The Thunder traded away Harden and other filler to the Rockets and in return got Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and three draft picks that turned into Steven Adams, Alex Abrines and Mitch McGary. Adams is the only player from that trade still on the Thunder roster while James Harden has gone on to the lead the Rockets to the postseason seven years in a row, win an MVP and been an MVP finalist multiple times. He has had multiple trips to the Western Conference Finals and has evolved into one of the best offensive players this league has ever seen. The Thunder gave that up, because they didn’t want to give him five million additional dollars. It’s been routinely discussed as one of the greatest what ifs of all time for the Thunder but no one really discusses it from a league-wide perspective. That’s what we will break down today. We’ll talk about the Thunder as well, but this trade changed NBA History forever. There’s a little to more it than Oklahoma City. 

Oklahoma City Thunder

The Thunder had already extended Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka by the time it came to negotiating Harden’s extension. These were the reigning Western Conference Champions. One would think that that should be kept together, but Sam Presti and the front office thought otherwise. Since the James Harden trade, the Thunder went to the Western Conference Finals twice with Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka together, but never reached the NBA Finals. Imagine if they had all been kept together. James Harden would’ve been a massive help in the 2016 Western Conference Finals when the Thunder had a 3-1 lead over the 73-win Golden State Warriors. The Thunder traded Jeremy Lamb to the Charlotte Hornets for Luke Ridnour and a second-round pick. Kevin Martin was involved in a three-team trade that ended up in the Thunder acquiring Szymon Szewcyk. The Thunder ultimately got nothing out of the Harden trade. Don’t get me wrong, Steven Adams is a good player, but he’s not James Harden, and seeing what has happened to the Thunder ever since Kevin Durant left, one can’t help but imagine what the team would be like had they chose to keep Harden. The Thunder traded Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Ersan Ilyasova, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, right before Kevin Durant left, in an attempt to make cap room and prepare for his potential departure. He left for the Golden State Warriors and Russell Westbrook was left on his own. A team that once had three superstars on it, was now down to the worst of the three. The Thunder would play the 2016-17 season out and Russell Westbrook made history by becoming the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double over an NBA season. Westbrook won the MVP but ultimately the season ended in a first round playoff loss to MVP Finalist James Harden and the Rockets. The Thunder realized that if they wanted to compete with the Rockets and Warriors, they would need a second star. So using the pieces they acquired in the Serge Ibaka trade, they sent out Oladipo and Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George. They also traded Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 2nd round draft pick, that turned into Mitchell Robinson, to the New York Knicks for Carmelo Anthony. All those players that were given up for Anthony would have contributed more to the Thunder than Anthony ever did. After two embarrassing first round exit losses in back to back seasons to the Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers, Paul George wanted out. Possibly regretting re-signing with the franchise in 2018, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers to join Kawhi Leonard to form a title contender for the next few seasons. If the Thunder never trade James Harden, Kevin Durant might not have left in 2016. They would have never acquired Paul George from Indiana or Carmelo Anthony from New York. If the Thunder never traded James Harden, they could have potentially won an NBA title or even multiple titles. However, they threw all that away because they didn’t want to pay Harden an extra five million dollars. Now they’re stuck with no Kevin Durant, no Paul George and Russell Westbrook on the decline on a supermax contract that ends in 2023. They’re being forced into a rebuild and until they get off of that contract, it’s not looking like the Thunder will be in any position to contend for a title anytime soon. 

Houston Rockets

If the Thunder had known what James Harden would’ve become I’m sure they never would have traded him, but they did, and the Rockets got him for nothing. The Rockets were rebuilding after the end of the Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming era, and James Harden fell right into their lap courtesy of Sam Presti. The Rockets have gone to the postseason all seven years that James Harden has been there. That includes two Western Conference Finals appearances that ended in losses to the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors acquisition of Kevin Durant in 2016 caused the Rockets to get more aggressive in the offseason and acquired Chris Paul from the Los Angeles Clippers for Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell and other filler. The trade helped the Rockets take the Warriors to 7 Games in the Western Conference Finals in 2018 and helped put the Clippers into position for where they are today, but we’ll talk about that later. If the Rockets never acquire Harden they very well could still be rebuilding. Knowing Daryl Morey, they likely could’ve acquired a different star, but probably not one on the level of James Harden, and they never would have traded for Chris Paul, which would have altered the Clippers future.  

Golden State Warriors

Kevin Durant left the Thunder for the Warriors after losing to the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals after blowing a 3-1 lead to them. Kevin Durant’s arrival in Golden State made them unbeatable. The Warriors won back to back titles in 2017 and 18, Durant winning Finals MVP in both of those series. So what would have the Warriors been had Durant not showed up? In 2016-17 the Warriors would have faced the San Antonio Spurs without Kevin Durant, but that ultimately wouldn’t have mattered because Zaza Pachulia stepped under Kawhi Leonard’s ankle, effectively ending the series. The Warriors would have gone on to play the Cavaliers and without Durant, the Cavaliers would have won that series and the Warriors would be 1-2 in the Finals. In 2018, Curry missed 31 games and it’s entirely possible they could have missed the postseason that year. The Warriors went 17-14 in the games Curry missed and that was with Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. In 2019 they would have gone to the NBA Finals but lost to Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors, becoming 1-3 in the NBA Finals, with their one finals win being tainted by the Cavaliers not being fully healthy. If James Harden had never been traded, Kevin Durant might not have ever left, meaning the Warriors don’t win multiple championships, and the Cavs reaping the benefits.

Cleveland Cavaliers

Kevin Durant’s arrival in Golden State prevented the Cavs from winning more than the one championship that was won in 2016. LeBron James left for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018 after carrying an awful Cavs roster to the NBA Finals and getting swept by Durant and the Warriors. If Durant never arrives, the Cavs would have won back to back championships in 2016-17. Going back to back may have caused Kyrie Irving to not request a trade. However, since his trade request came from not wanting to be second fiddle to LeBron any longer, let’s say he still gets traded, but this time not to the Boston Celtics, but to the Phoenix Suns. The Cavs had agreed to a trade in principal, before it fell apart, with the Phoenix Suns and Indiana Pacers that would have landed Paul George and Eric Bledsoe in Cleveland and Kyrie Irving in Phoenix Suns. This time a Cavs roster comprised of James, George, Love and Bledsoe would have taken on possibly the Oklahoma City Thunder with Durant, Westbrook and Harden in the NBA Finals. We honestly don’t know if that Thunder core would have still been together six years later, but it’s possible. If the Cavs were able to snag Paul George and Bledsoe and then win the NBA Title. Maybe LeBron James doesn’t leave for LA. Maybe he and Paul George both re-sign and form a powerful contender in the Eastern Conference to compete with Kawhi Leonard’s Raptors, Giannis’ Bucks and Embiid’s Sixers. 

Los Angeles Lakers

Following the Kyrie Irving trade to the Boston Celtics, the Cavs roster was awful. LeBron James dragged the Cavs to the finals in 2018. James was a free agent and had given Cleveland everything he had. He fulfilled his promise of bringing a title back home and owed the city nothing else. He left Cleveland and went to Los Angeles. After an unsuccessful first year full of drama and speculation. The Lakers acquired Anthony Davis in a blockbuster trade from the New Orleans Pelicans and also tried recruiting Kawhi Leonard before he ultimately signed with the Clippers with Paul George. But as we discussed above, what if LeBron and Paul George were together in Cleveland? Does Anthony Davis still request a trade to the Lakers if LeBron isn’t there? I would imagine he still wants out of New Orleans, but do the Lakers feel the need to grab him if they can’t? Maybe they do, and maybe they have Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard decides to sign with them instead of the Clippers, and the Lakers are the team to beat in the West instead of the Clippers. 

Los Angeles Clippers

I’m sure you’re thinking about Paul George in terms of how the Clippers were affected by the James Harden trade, and you’re right. Paul George is one of the dominoes that fell, but there’s more to it than that. If Durant never joins Golden State, do the Clippers feel the need to break up the Big Three of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan. Worth remembering the trades of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin ultimately landed them Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverly, Landry Shamet and the cap space necessary to land them Kawhi Leonard and the ability to trade for Paul George. The Clippers were able to build a title contender off the James Harden trade, but if that never happens, where are they? The Clippers playoff runs were almost always ended in injuries to Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and were never truly able to compete for a title like they should have been able to. So maybe they still trade Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. Detroit is still likely where Blake Griffin lands, but what about Chris Paul? James Harden isn’t in Houston, he’s in OKC. What team is going to trade for him or do they trade him at all? Do they just trade Blake and acquire Tobias Harris from Detroit? But that doesn’t bring them any closer to a title than before. The Clippers are much harder to figure out because everything they have done has been because of James Harden being traded to the Rockets.

Conclusion

Oklahoma City trading James Harden caused Durant to leave for Golden State and win two championships with them. It knocked over a series of dominoes that ended up bringing LeBron James and Anthony Davis to the Lakers and Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to the Clippers. The Thunder after getting to the NBA Finals with their core of Durant, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka, threw all of it away because they didn’t want to pay Harden an extra five million dollars. If they knew what we all know now, they would have kept him. James Harden may never win a championship, but his trade helped a lot of other franchises win championships.

# Players who can shoot

* **Danny Green.** Shot 45.5% from beyond the arc last season on 5.4 attempts per game; posted true shooting mark of 63.2%. ORTG of 119 on a championship-winning Raptors team.

* **Quinn Cook.** Slashed 47 / 41 / 77 last year, hitting 2.8 threes per 36 minutes. Shoots 42% from beyond the arc for his career and 79% from the line, making him an ideal off-the-bench fit for LeBron.

* **Troy Daniels.** Underrated signing, a 28-year old player who's shot exactly 40.0% for his career from deep. Averaged 2.0 threes per game on 5.0 attempts for the Phoenix Suns, and that mark should only increase with LeBron's passing and gravity.

* **Alex Caruso.** Small sample size, but has shot 39.8% from three point land on 1.5 attempts for his career. Jumped to 48% last year on two attempts, and his FT% (80%) largely backs up his shooting profile. Excited to see what he can do this season.

# Players who are deceptively athletic and can defend

* **JaVale McGee.** Shot 62.4% from the floor last season with 64% of his shots coming within three feet of the basket. He shot 76.2% at the rim. Has averaged a DRTG of 103 over the past four seasons, and a mean NTRTG of +15 for the same span.

* **Talen Horton-Tucker.** Lakers draft pick, immense physical traits. 6'4' with a 7'1 wingspan (second largest wingspan:height ratio in the NBA); posted a 98.1 DRTG in college. Heavy and can guard multiple positions a la Draymond Green, though Horton-Tucker is still young and raw.

# Idiot for LeBron to yell at

* **Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.** Played one month of season under house arrest, proceeded to brick every three during that timespan. Has shot 34.5% from deep on 4.9 attempts for his career. Averages 41.2% shooting from the field.

I, for one, think the Lakers did extremely well filling out their roster. They inked four reliable bench shooters (plus Kyle Kuzma), drafted a versatile defender in Horton-Tucker, and got their scapegoat in KCP. Despite not getting Kawhi, very strong offseason for the Lakers.

ChillEP,t3_cacxbx,nba,"In my opinion Darius Garland was a **really** bad pick. I think this kid has potential to be one of the worst picks we’ve seen in the past few years.

Undersized, poor defender, and at PG but has virtually no playmaking ability. The fact that he had more turnovers than assists in college is concerning. Granted it was only 5 games but still a bad sign, especially on a team like Vanderbilt who has easier competition compared to most top prospects. He played 5 games and showed that besides shooting 3s, he can’t do literally anything else at a high level. He then had a season ending injury, and somehow this rose his stock until he was picked 5th? 

This dude doesn’t really seem to have any strengths but shooting, which probably won’t be as strong in the NBA when he’s so small. 

His ceiling imo is a bench guy who can come in and be an okay spark with his shooting. His lack of size, playmaking and finishing will keep him from ever being a legit NBA starter. 

Obviously I’m no professional scout but I really was confused by this pick.

*These winners might take your spots:*

SAC: finishing 39-43 while taking a huge jump in player improvement. Sacramento's biggest question is Head Coach Luke Walton's 1st year on the job. As the 4th best team in the Pacific Div, They'll have plenty to prove that they got some stars too.

&amp;#x200B;

OKC: Notable signing: SGA, Danilo (via trade) Notable loss: Paul George This is the biggest question mark by far! We've seen Westbrook in a similar position when KD left. After 3 straight 1st round exits, going for a total of 4 playoff wins in that stretch, Sam Presti is gonna have to bet on his All Star Guard to push them to at least 47 wins to have a shot.

NOP: **Well I'll be damned,** u/chungus_wungus **in shambles** And I would be, since on paper, New Orleans looks pretty good but there's a difference between getting your drivers permit and taking the driver's test. With a Haul GM David Griffin pulled in, I wouldn't be too surprised if NOLA gets above .500 and finishes between 42-47 wins.

&amp;#x200B;

DAL: Notable players who left last year: Dirk Notable players on roster for this year: Dirk(G), Dirk(PF) and Dirk(C) Under Rick Carlisle, a winning record should be expected if all Dirks come to form. But they currently sit as the 3rd best team in Texas but can easily jump to 2.

*I'll always remember you...*

MEM: Grit &amp; Grind is gone, its players gone but not the hope that came from it and the franchise. With the roster currently constructed, Memphis will no doubt compete but unfortunately aren't cracking over .500 barring some miracle of a season

*...eh, I remember you*

MIN: Sorry Minny fans, but 33wins is most likely what you guys are looking at again. Removing that outlier season when Jimmy took the timberwolves to

the playoffs, Wiggins and Towns will have to prove they can get there without him for the first time in their young careers.

EverthingIsADildo,t3_ca2n8g,nba,"Keith Van Horn hadn’t played since 2006, taking time off to spend with his family. 

Aaron McKie last appeared in an NBA game in March 2007 but was currently employed as an assistant coach for the 76ers. 

The NBA careers of both players were effectively over. 

However, since neither player submitted retirement paperwork to the NBA, the last teams they played for (Dallas and the Lakers, respectively) still owned their Bird Rights. 

When Dallas wanted to acquire Jason Kidd from the Nets, they didn’t have enough salary to send back in the trade and they were already over the cap. The solution? Sign Van Horn to a “three year” deal under the Bird exception and include him in the trade. Van Horn made 4.3 million dollars and never played another minute in an NBA game. 

The Lakers were in a similar situation when they wanted to trade for Pau Gasol. Without enough salary to include in the trade, they signed McKie to a contract that paid him $750,000. McKie was released by Memphis in October that year without, to the best of my knowledge, ever having put a Grizzlies uniform on. 

The Lakers went on to win the NBA championship in 2009 where Gasol was a major factor in the finals leading the team in rebounds and blocks, he trailed only Kobe Bryant in minutes per game, led the team in FG% (if you exclude Luke Walton who only took 10 shots in the entire series) and was second in PPG (behind Bryant). 

It took a little longer for Dallas to win the title in 2011 but a then 38 year old Kidd played a large part throughout the playoffs leading all players in 3 pointers made, assists and steals.

The “loophole” that allowed these trades to take place is now closed as teams can no longer sign-and-trade players that didn’t finish the prior season on their roster but these trades are an interesting footnote to the championships of those teams and an amusing window into how convoluted transactions can be in the NBA.","In 2008, two teams included retired players in trades for players that would eventually play significant roles in winning those teams a championship",post
blesidB_cheesemakers,t3_caatjv,nba,"**Lakers**

+ Defense.  This team shouldn’t have much trouble to score but defensively Danny Green, Caruso, AD, are the only good-great defenders.  Lebron can hold his own in the playoffs and Cousins is good against other bigs but they have limitations against quicker players.

+ Lebron’s age/mileage.  Lebron has more help but the responsibility of running the offense will be on him come playoff time and if Lebron’s mileage catches up with him this team is done.

**Clippers**

+ Point Guard/Forward.  Who is playing point guard/forward for this team?  I’m assuming it will be Kawhi/PG with Lou/Pat handling secondary ball handling.  Kawhi can make the simple passes but most of his effectiveness as a passer come from penetrating and forcing the defense to help than pin point passes like Chris Paul or Draymond.  Kawhi will be playing ~60-65 games so it will be interesting to see how PG/Lou/Pat do in his absence.  Come playoff time Kawhi/PG/Lou will be the ones with the ball looking to score first and pass if help comes.

+ Bigs.  The league went smaller the past 5 years because of what Golden State was able to do.  Bigs are still important and especially during the regular season.  Come playoff time Zubac and Montrez will have to defend and keep these guys off the glass; Jokic/Millsap, Nurkic/Whiteside, AD/Cousins, Looney/WCS(an underrated pair), Gobert, and possibly Horford/Embiid(yikes).  Philly is definitely a nightmare matchup for this Clippers team.

KagsTheOneAndOnly,t3_ca4ua9,nba,"Necessary caveats: 

- SAMPLE SIZE (22 games) is still quite small so yes im aware extrapolating wins and losses across an entire season like this will almost certainly come with no small amount of variance and error

- The games Kawhi sat out tended to come on back to backs or ""easier"" games against below-.500 teams (the 5 losses came against playoff level opponents). 

- Marc Gasol's arrival impacted the team in some ways too (5-2 in games without Kawhi after his arrival, or 59-win pace).


**WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID**, it's really (annoyingly) impressive how solid the Raps roster is (in the regular season, at least). The other members of Raps big 5 stepped up big too when Leonard sat out: 

Ibaka: 18/8/1 on 64TS%, FVV: 14/3/6 on 56TS%, Gasol: 10/7/4 on 53TS%.


- - - 

p.s. Gasol's arrival tweaked the rest of the Raptors' stats in interesting ways too, and will perhaps reflect next season's results more accurately given that Gasol re-signed. 

In 7 games with Gasol but without Kawhi (5-2 record):

Siakam- 24/8/4 on 63TS%.

rickety3828,t3_ca8yat,nba,"One thing I've been seeing a lot is that trading Westbrook to Miami would be hard because the Heat can't trade any firsts until 2028. That's true but it's because of the 2023 pick that is now owed to the Thunder. The protections are:

2023: 1-14
2024: 1-14
2025: 1-14
2026: unprotected

Because it could convey in any of those years, those picks can't be traded and 2027 pick can't be traded because of the Stepien rule.

So if Miami unprotects that pick, it would open up those later picks.

So something along the lines of:

Miami receives: Westbrook

OKC receives: Dragic + Johnson + Herro + unprotect 2023 1st + 2025 1st (unprotected)

Miami gives up one additional pick, but it also gives them the ability to trade the 2027 1st, if some other deal comes around in the next few years or they can also now do pick swaps for 2024 and 2026 if the right deal comes up. They could do Waiters instead of Johnson but because of the 3point shooting I think he probably fits best with Westbrook and Butler. 

For the Thunder, Goran is expiring so that's good, Johnson has two years, Thunder were interested in Herro but he shot up draft boards. The 2023 is more valuable, and they get the 2025 1st. They still have to much salary but Gallo should be movable.",OKC - Miami trade is actually more possible than it seems,post

i had no clue who that was but he made three all NBA teams and five all star teams in his first 9 years in the league.

Turns out he ruptured a disk between the third and fourth vertebrae. not a doctor but sounds real bad. was out the rest of the 87 season, the 88 and 89 and tried to make a comeback in 90 but couldnt.

Uncle_Freddy,t3_ca8jy6,nba,"Shamelessly lifted from a comment I left in another thread about the Supermax because I was curious to hear more peoples’ thoughts on it, I present to you the outline for an “Ultramax” (credit /u/ElDuderino_92 for the name):

I like the idea of making an “Ultramax” contract that is of unlimited value and doesn’t count against the salary cap at all, but only if it is offered to a player that you drafted and has been on your team for x amount of years (possibly until the end of their first non-rookie contract, but that is sometimes too late for trying to keep star players).

Basically, if this were a reality, then small market teams would be given a literal blank check to keep their homegrown superstars, as they are the only team that would actually be able to offer their stars “market value,” as every true superstar in the league is still underpaid compared to their value on (and off) the court.

The simple adjustment to the cap would be to lower it the amount of a full max slot, because if they didn’t, larger-market teams (or teams with richer owners) would theoretically have an advantage over small-market teams.

This system would also reveal which teams are truly interested in winning and which teams are significantly tighter with their pockets, and would allow the fans to see who was to blame if their superstar player wants out of town.

Because it would potentially put NBA owners under fire and would force them to spend more money, don’t ever really count on this being a reality, but it’s a nice dream.","For your consideration, the Ultramax: a Supermax replacement to help small-market teams keep their homegrown superstars",post

mrgeriatric,t3_ca7uym,nba,"It’s the offseason so I put together my top 100 list for the upcoming season. When ranking players I asked myself the question, “Which player will provide more *value* towards winning in the upcoming season?"" I try to evaluate guys evenly between **value in a vacuum** and **value when playing w/ aggregate talent**. What I mean by that is Zach LaVine has a far better chance to lead a shitty team to 40 wins than Gary Harris because of his ability to create off the dribble himself, and conversely Harris is probably a much easier fit schematically with other talented players (on a team like Denver) because he defends, moves, and shoots the ball extremely well. I wouldn’t consider one substantially better than the other. I also like to assume relative health with players that have injury history. I asked myself how many games I would *optimistically* guess each player would play and then adjusted their value accordingly. So for most, injuries were not factored in, unless they are starting the season with a serious injury. If at this point you don't think it is truly sad how serious I took making a subjective list to post on the internet on my Sunday morning, then I don’t know what to say.

kobmug,t3_caa0kp,nba,"The Toronto Raptors are a taxpaying team which means that they can only acquire 125% of the outgoing salary plus $100,000 in a trade.

Russell Westbrook's salary for the 2019-20 season: $38,506,482

Paul George's salary for the 2019-20 season: $33,005,556

Total: $71,512,038
____

This means that $57,109,630 must be sent out by the Raptors in order to match salary. We know that Siakam and 4 future unprotected firsts had to be included in the trade. Siakam earns $2,351,839 in the coming season which brings the total additional salary necessary to $54,757,791.

___

Some possible combinations to match salaries are:

1) Lowry + Ibaka + Siakam

2) Lowry + Powell + FVV + Siakam

3) Gasol  + Ibaka + Powell + Siakam

4) Gasol + Ibaka + FVV + Siakam

5) Gasol + Ibaka + OG Anunoby + Siakam

6) Gasol + Lowry + Siakam

___

In my opinion the most sensible trade from a roster balance perspective is #1 where the Raptors send Lowry + Ibaka + Siakam + 4 future unprotected firsts for Westbrook and Paul George.

____

Assuming Kawhi and Danny Green stay in Toronto and they still sign Stanley Johnson the Raptors' depth chart now looks like:

PG: Westbrook / FVV

SG: Green / Powell

SF: Paul George / OG

PF: Kawhi Leonard / Johnson

C: Gasol

____
Total salary: $173,539,276*

This put their total salary $40,912,276 above the luxury tax threshold of $132,627,000. 

This would result in a tax bill of $140,245,587 and a total wage bill of $313,784,863 for the 2019-20 season.

____

*Note that here I have assumed that Danny Green and Stanley Johnson sign for the same amount they received in reality.

KredditH,t3_ca01gf,nba,"I keep seeing this term thrown around over and over. The Ringer even wrote a piece today where they called Kawhi and Paul George a super team. So did the NY post. 

We called 2017 warriors were a ""super team"" because they had two top five players and two all-stars in supporting cast with a good bench. That's reasonable, it's just an obscene collection of talent.

We called the 2012 Heat a ""super team"" because they literally had for most people the 2nd best player of all-time at his absolute peak, along with another top-5 player D-wade and then a supporting all-star in Chris Bosh. 

However, the Clippers, with a top-5 player Kawhi and a top-ten guy if fully recovered in George is NOT a super team. That's what we call an elite team. They are championship contender. They are going to be really good and they might even win a championship. That is not a super team. Their Vegas odds of winning a title are estimated at 20% with the vig taken out. That's not a super team. 

The Lakers have 34-year-old LeBron and another top-ten guy in Anthony Davis. That is not a super team. That is an elite team, a championship contender, and a stacked team. Their championship odds are close to 20% as well. That's one out of 5, that's not a ""super team."" They might win a title. That's why we call them an elite team. If they had Kawhi then it's more reasonable to call them a super team. The Lakers in 08-10 won back to back titles with a legend and multiple all-stars yet nobody called them a super team. If you don't know if a team is an overwhelming favorite to win a title, then they're not a superteam.

The Rockets two years ago won 60+ games with a top five player and then CP3 who at the time was in his last year of being considered a top ten player. That's still not a super team. Here's a basic rule: If you don't know whether a team should be called a super team, then they're not a super team. 

Being an elite team with multiple all-stars does not = super team. There's a difference.

&gt; For instance, the new Designated Veteran contract, which allows players who have between seven and nine years of service time in the league to sign a contract with a starting salary equal to 35 percent of the salary cap—but only if those players hit certain criteria—has created issues for several teams. Faced with the prospect of having to hand DeMarcus Cousins a five-year extension worth over $200 million, the Sacramento Kings instead elected to trade him to the New Orleans Pelicans earlier in year. Two years ahead of Jimmy Butler's free agency, the Chicago Bulls decided that paying him a super-max contract and being a fringe playoff contender was a worse option than trading him for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, and the right to move up nine picks in the draft.",[Serious] What do you think the changes to the next CBA will be?,post

That is a HUGE jump in just a single offseason, and this is especially important considering how well Lebron plays with good 3-point shooting. Also, the Lakers still have the cap to sign one or two more free agents. Here are some important numbers to know for context, however:

&amp;#x200B;

Danny Green: Shot a staggering 47.4% on catch and shoots on 4.5 attempts per game. He will almost certainly not shoot at that high a level again, but as long as he stays above 40% he is an incredible pickup

If not, it still seems very likely he will shoot somewhere between those two numbers

&amp;#x200B;

Demarcus Cousins: Shot a terrible 26.4% on catch and shoots on 3 attempts per game. In his 2nd season with the Pelicans, however, he shot 36.4% on catch and shoots on 5.3 attempts per game, but that was pre-achilles tear.

#Lottery

The lottery odds (not the actual picks) would shake out like this with those standings.

1. Hornets (140 combinations, 1-140)
2. Cavaliers (140 combinations, 141-280)
3. Grizzlies (140 combinations, 281-420)
4. Wizards (125 combinations, 421-545)
5. Suns (98 combinations, 546-643) (randomly drew as tiebreaker)
6. Knicks (97 combinations, 644-740)
7. Bulls (75 combinations, 741-815)
8. Thunder (60 combinations, 816-875)
9. Hawks (45 combinations, 876-920)
10. Timberwolves (30 combinations, 921-950)
11. Pelicans (20 combinations, 951-970)
12. Pistons (15 combinations, 971-985)
13. Kings (10 combinations, 986-995)
14. Mavericks (5 combinations, 996-1000)

Then I'll RNG some numbers to determine which teams get the top 4 picks. The numbers I got are: 665, 780, 493, and 929, corresponding to the Knicks, Bulls, Wizards, and Timberwolves respectively. The order would then be:

1. Knicks
2. Bulls
3. Wizards
4. Timberwolves
5. Hornets
6. Cavaliers
7. Celtics (from Grizzlies)
8. Suns
9. Thunder
10. Hawks
11. Pelicans
12. Pistons
13. Kings
14. Mavericks",Post-FA 2020 season predictions,post

InternationalCow,t3_c9uk8m,nba,"&gt;Sources familiar with Kawhi’s thinking indicate Los Angeles was always the plan, in concert with championship contention, and if anything it was a credit to the Raptors that they made it this difficult a decision. During the playoffs, and even the Finals, sources indicate Kawhi and his advisor and uncle Dennis Robertson were focused on the Clippers, even as Toronto’s championship run unfolded. During the playoffs Robertson was overheard more than once in the post-game back-hall melees talking about leaving; even after Game 4 in Philadelphia, where Kawhi made the first of two shots in the series to save the season. The Clippers planned to pair Kawhi with 76ers wing and Kawhi’s friend, Jimmy Butler, and the Kawhi camp gauged Butler’s interest repeatedly. Sources indicate they were in contact even after the NBA Finals.

&gt;The title closed the gap. When Butler decided to sign with Miami instead when free agency opened, it seemed like a blow to the Clippers. Sources indicate Kawhi was genuinely undecided at the time; he wasn’t ready to leave Toronto yet. By Thursday night sources say the Clippers were telling people in the league they thought Kawhi was going back to Toronto.

&gt;It is not a teardown, but it is starting again, and the next question might involve what Ujiri wants to do after the greatest season of his career. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment is expected to engage in contract extension talks with their basketball architect. It should. He is elite.

&gt;And then, the bombshell. Yes, the Lakers made noise early in the week after striking out on Butler themselves. LeBron James reportedly offered to defer to Kawhi, with Anthony Davis as the third MVP-level player in the trio. But Kawhi was said to be concerned about the dysfunction in the organization, and two sources say Kawhi did not want to play on a super team with LeBron. The Lakers were also the only team who leaked anything during the process, which more than anything indicated they had no idea who they were really dealing with.

Kawhi went to both the Raptors and Clippers and asked them to trade for Paul George or Bradley Beal. OKC asked for Siakam, FVV, and 4 unprotected 1sts, + salary match. Talks never got serious. Raps weren't assured Kawhi would stay but it was presumed. Arthur doesn't think Westbrook was never in it.

Kawhi didn't want to play with Lebron. Lakers weren't close.If Kawhi was set on the Clippers from the beginning, there was a sense Butler would have gone there with him at the start of free agency.

East: PHI, BOS, BKN, NYK, CHA, ATL, IND, MEM

South: HOU, OKC, SAS, NOP, DAL, PHX, MIA, ORL

West: GS, LAC, SAC, LAL, POR, DEN, UTA

Top 4 from each division makes the playoffs

&amp;#x200B;

**My Prediction**

**North:** Milwaukee easily gets the top spot, Toronto and Detroit battle over the 2 &amp; 3 spot with Toronto having the better end to the season and sealing it, Minnesota then takes the 4th spot with the only serious threat being Chicago 5 games back.

1.) MIL

2.) TOR

3.) DET

4.) MIN

**East:** Philly is going to be an interesting team this year, I'm not sure how some teams are going to match up with their size. Philly takes the top spot because of that. Boston easily takes this second seed in this division until the year after next when Kevin Durant and Kyrie knock both Philly and Boston down a spot. Until then Brooklyn will still take the third spot pretty comfortably. The fourth spot will be a battle between Indiana and Memphis with it coming down to the last week of the season and Indiana prevailing.

1.) PHI

2.) BOS

3.) BKN

4.) IND

**South:** This division would be a complete toss up this year outside of Houston who would take the top spot very easily. New look OKC is interesting but I don't see them winning many games any time soon if they trade Westbrook (or even if they don't really). I think New Orleans will need a year to become impactful on the league but I don't see them winning many games this year either. You can always count on Popovic which is why I'm giving San Antonio the second seed. Miami with Jimmy Butler will be a good team somehow, and Dallas with Luka and Kristaps is unknown as of now, but I believe it will be good enough to battle Miami for the 3 &amp; 4 spots with Miami taking the 3.

1.) HOU

2.) SAS

3.) MIA

4.) DAL

**West:** Obviously this division is the best by a long shot, you could argue all 7 teams will make the playoffs next year. Everyone knows the landscape of the NBA changes every few years though, the South which is now the worst division was the best before the Golden State Era. With that said I think the top three are unanimous but the order is where no one is going to agree. For me I don't see anyone scoring 100 pts against the Clippers so i'm taking them as the top seed. Lakers will take the second spot with LeBron playing sidekick to AD. Golden State will take the third spot but not without a battle from Utah who will take the fourth spot.

Recieves: Russell Westbrook, Dion Waiters

Gives up: Chris Paul, Danuel House Jr., 2020 first round (own) unprotected, 2022 first round (own) unprotected


Why they do it: Paying a promising young guy in Danuel House and 2 late first rounders to upgrade from CP3 to Brody on similar contracts sounds like a fair price. Additionally they take on Dion on a bad contract, but he could be a positive for this year's playoff push

**Miami**

Recieves: Chris Paul

Gives up: Goran Dragic, Dion Waiters, 2025 first round (own) lottery protected

Why they do it: With Miami being a team thats content with being a perennial 8 seed, teaming up Jimmy and CP3 for the foreseeable future seems like a move they would be happy about. They get rid of Dion's contract and an expiring while paying a first rounder in the far future.

Recieves: Goran Dragic, D. House Jr.,  2020 first round (Rockets) unprotected, 2022 first round (Rockets) unprotected, 2025 first round (Heat) lottery protected

Maybe on the flip side, franchises would have to wait until at least that same time frame is fulfilled before trading a player (to protect the player)?

If a trade is requested by either party before the time requirements, and a mutual agreement is made, the requesting party has to pay a tax to the other party?

I understand that franchises don’t have to be loyal to a player and I support the idea of a player being a able to decide their careers, however, I feel there should also be a protection in place for franchises as well to prevent a player requesting a trade one year into a long term contract, especially given there may be players they couldn’t acquire during the time they have to pay the contract due to cap space.

And almost assuredly they prove themselves to not be worthy if that contract and get hated on here and by blog boys everywhere. After this contract season who will be most hated in a couple of years? In other words who will not live up to their contract?,Now that the trades are finalized who will be most hated players because of their salary in a couple of years?,post

araj_2000,t3_ca2yid,nba,"I respect the hell out of kawhis game but I’ve been following his career and I’ve realized he’s been extremely, extremely fortunate throughout his basketball career. 

1.) Goes through college and is good but not legendary or anything. Butttt he gets drafted by a phenomenal spurs team that excels in development and coaching, and turns into a much better player because of it. 

2.) Wins a championship with the spurs and wins finals MVP, which while deserved was probably the weakest finals mvp performance in the last 10 years (maybe 2015 iggy was worse)

3.) He gets into a feud with the spurs org  over injuries. This is very controversial so I won’t get too into it but he forced his way out of the team that ultimately built him and got traded with his pal Danny to another VERY good team that literally did everything they could to make him comfortable.

4.) He plays lights out in the eastern conference playoffs, but gets lucky as HELL in the finals with the warriors losing pretty much their whole roster to injury. People will say “a ring is a ring injuries always happen”. But the injuries are extra significant because knowing now that kawhi was gonna leave after one year, if he had pulled off this Clippers-PG shit without winning the raptors a championship he’d be viewed as weak and a complete snake. And had warriors had KD for even one entire game I don’t think kawhi wins that ring.

Haribo_Happy_Cola,t3_cacy1y,nba,"The supermax is a nice concept but flawed and obviously that's not an unpopular opinion. One of the solutions that I agree with is taking some of the money off the books that way both sides win.
Without further ado here's a pros cons list of adjusting the super max

&gt; 30% 

Pros: Gives a discount to a degree while also compensating teams who don't have supermax eligible players 

Cons: probably won't fix the issue of handicapping small market teams

= 30% 

Pros: Small markets remain competitive and rewards loyalty. A good balance

Cons: FA is a no brainer in terms of money. Leaving personal issues like Kawhi and Butler to be the only deciding factor if a player wants to choose since 1 team can offer more money with the same penalty

&lt; 30% 

Pros: Possibly more parity because small market teams can develop superstars, keep them, and still have less on the cap than big market attractions. Bottom Dwellers can now, if they develop players, build teams easier since they can keep their stars like Booker and also fill out their roster with the extra cap space.

Cons: Anyone that's eligible will want the max knowing that it's less penalty. Owners will most likely be paying a lot more than normal as well since 2 super maxes will become a thing. Not realistic at all

The small sample size of 5 players (Curry, Wall, Harden. WB, Dame) has 2 successes and 3 disasters, but what's interesting is the larger market (Houston and GS) are fine, but the smaller markets are not. Probably coincidence because curry and harden are just that good and WB is only a concern because of how they overpayed everyone else on OKC, but Wizards are crippled and everyone expects Portland to be too and these 2 teams don't have allure like golden state and Houston do (does Houston have allure?)

Free agency season is significantly more hyped than the All-star break nowadays, so take advantage of it and really lean in to the spectacle that the modern NBA has become. 


I'm confident you could generate enough money from the event if it was even somewhat televised that it would be free for both players and ownership, or if you really want to get political about it, have league ownership fund it on a ""Donation"" basis, with a minimum and maximum donation amount. If Mark Cuban wants to blow 5 Million dollars in his portion of funding to show how cool a place to play Dallas is, let him.

**Why**

**DET**: Absorbs long-term contracts and picks. They're on the phone with Presti, who's also on the phone with Morey. It's like two pyros and their friend with the chemistry kit.

**OKC**: Gets under the cap. Griffin's contract is a year shorter. Can trade Capela to a contender for more a$$et$ and get even further under the cap.

**HOU**: Loads up with three players who will help them win. Westbrook and Drummond's bullyball might share the load enough that all three are fresh come the playoffs.

- PG went to a team where he probably has a much better shot at the title. He has already tried to win in OKC and it simply didn't work. If he bailed on the team last year as a FA, OKC would still be in a similar bad situation contacts wise and not have any picks for the future.

LeatherFart,t3_ca2xrf,nba,"Kawhi told the Clippers he would come if they got George but never gave the Raps the same promise. Reports have been conflicting but overall it seems his sights were set very strongly on the Clips.

Kawhi wanted to go to the Clippers, but ideally wanted another star there with him. If he told the Clippers he was signing with them prior to them getting George, then they wouldn't have had nearly the same incentive to give the requisite massive haul. Therefore, Kawhi had to set up a smokescreen so the Clippers thought that they truly had to get George. This smokescreen involved feigning interest in re-signing with the Raptors and encouraging them to get George also. That way the pressure was on the Clips to get the deal done, so Kawhi could get his star to be paired with. Kawhi knew the Clippers would offer more for George so the plan would work. Further evidence of this is that as late as Thursday night Clippers executives thought he was going back to Toronto, which shows they were indeed desperate to execute the George trade.

Might sound like a crazy conspiracy lol, I get that. But based on everything I've read, which has been all day, I genuinely believe that this is roughly how things went down

HistoryArchaeology,t3_ca63kk,nba,"So, let me start by telling you: I'm more than happy with our pick in this Draft!

Isaiah Roby has played very good in the first two games of the Summer League.

vs Brooklyn: 10 PTS in 28 minutes(5-12 FG, 0-2 3PM), 4 reb, 1ast, 1stl, and 2blk.

vs Houston: 14 PTS in 25 minutes(6-11 FG, 1-4 3PM), 7 reb, 3ast, 2stl, and 2blk.

I was really impressed by his ball handling skills and defense. Roby’s physical tools are impressive: 6-foot-8, 230 pounds with a 7-foot-3 wingspan, and 21.4 years old at the time of the draft. Isaiah Roby’s feel, basketball IQ, and coordination stand out. For a player as young as Roby, he is incredibly smart. His passing ability is excellent; Roby can pass on the move, out of the short roll, or as a ball-handler. He doesn’t have star upside but he has all of the makings of a very high-level role player in the NBA.",First impressions on Isaiah Roby (Mavs Rookie),post

OverallPrettyGood,t3_ca0ttp,nba,"I'm shamelessly stealing this from a recent shitpost, but I think it's a cool idea.  Now that the big signings have been made and we're done with the draft, I thought it would be fun to do.

**Tier 1: Contenders**

*Milwaukee, Philadelphia*

This should be obvious.  These two teams are fresh off great seasons where they made strong but unsuccessful playoff pushes.  

Losing Brogdon hurts, but the Bucks have retained most of their depth from last season.  With Giannis still trending upwards, they're due for another solid run. 

For Philly, it remains to be seen whether replacing Jimmy with Richardson and Horford will be an upgrade or not.  Either way, they were a few odd bounces away from taking the eventual champs to OT in Game 7 last postseason, so it's hard to imagine them not making another strong push this season.  

**Tier 2:  Dark Horses**

*Boston, Indiana, Toronto, Brooklyn*

None of these teams are on-paper threats for the title, but any of them could make a run at the Eastern Conference if something clicks or Milwaukee/Philly sees a major injury.  

The Celtics obviously lost a huge piece in Al Horford, but they were able to offset the loss of Kyrie Irving nicely by adding Kemba.  If their young players take a step and Gordon Hayward looks better after another summer of recovery, they could actually improve on their shaky last season.

Indiana will be without Oladipo to start the season, but getting him back could make them a real threat in the East.  They're now one of the league's youngest teams and Myles Turner should also be expected to build on his DPOY-caliber season last year.

Losing Kawhi stings badly for Toronto, and losing Green hurts the team's depth.  Gasol and Lowry also may take a step back given their age.  However, Siakam should improve and the team played at a very high level in games without Kawhi last season.  They should still be solid.

Brooklyn, meanwhile, at the very least got deeper with the addition of DeAndre Jordan.  We'll see how much of an upgrade Kyrie is over D'Angelo Russell, but with their young players developing and a solid big man joining the frontcourt, they should be in the hunt in the East. 

**Tier 3: Competitive Teams**

*Detroit, Orlando, Miami, Atlanta*

The Pistons got to the playoffs last season and had an All-Star in Blake Griffin.  They got clowned once they got to the postseason, but have made moves this offseason to better their roster and compete at a higher level.  Adding Derrick Rose should shore up their backcourt and Sekou could be a sneaky good pick.

Orlando was a bit of a surprise playoff team last year, and this offseason they managed to keep their key ingredient in Nikola Vucevic.  I see no reason they shouldn't be back in the mix for the playoffs.

The Heat weren't able to get there last season, but the addition of Jimmy Butler could change that.  They've lost some strong players in Richardson, ~~Olynyk~~ (my mistake), and Whiteside, but they've likely improved by adding an All-Star player.  Could be an interesting race for the final playoff spot.

I also think the Hawks fall into this tier.  After an All-Star caliber second half for Trae Young and a 19.5 ppg season from John Collins, it seems like their young core is ready to take the next step and start winning with more regularity.  I have a hard time imagining they won't finish ahead of the teams in the final tier.  

**Tier 4:  Likely Lottery Teams**

*Chicago, New York, Washington, Charlotte, Cleveland*

Barring something unexpected happening, I think it's fair to say these teams are unlikely to be in the playoff hunt.  Most of them are young and still building up a core for the future.  In Washington's case, they're going to have to spend the year riding out John Wall's injury and should be back to being a competitive team if he comes back full strength.  Out of this group, the Knicks might have the most potential to make noise after adding some decent quality players in free agency.  However, I think it's most likely that all five of these teams are back in the lottery next Summer.",Ranking the Eastern Conference teams by tier,post

CICERO9K,t3_c9t82z,nba,"Around the very start of Free Agency, rumours popped up about Kawhi Leonard contacting Kevin Durant in talks of teaming up together, but Kevin Durant still signed with the Nets. Durant and Kawhi couldn't have signed together on the Lakers, but rather on the other LA team - the Clippers. The New York Knicks was another team linked with such scenario, but I doubt they would have chosen New York.

Link to *Adrian Wojnarowski's and Ramona Shelburne's* ESPN story mentioning this: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27081670/sources-kd-kawhi-mulling-free-agent-scenarios

Not to mention the rumours from *The Athletic's Sam Amick* that there's a possibility Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler may team up with the LA Clippers. Quote:

&gt; There are many scenarios seemingly in play, but sources say one in particular looks increasingly possible: Butler teaming up with Leonard on the Clippers. There are strong indications that Leonard is interested in having Butler as a running mate, and it’s the sort of powerful pairing that would certainly vault the Clippers into contention.

I believe *Adrian Wojnarowski* also mentioned this as being one of the potential scenarios.

Presti decided to trade Illyasova to the 76ers for Jerami Grant, who has turned out to be a nice piece for OKC.

Obviously hindsight is 20/20 and all that so I'm in no way calling anyone who contributed to this list stupid or anything, but it's still quite funny to read people's opinions on these players now that we know exactly how their careers turned out.

On LeBron:
&gt;So much for surprises. But before the Pistons make their pick at No. 2, Jon in Sarasota, Fla., has a question about ""King James"" ... ""I don't know what the hype is with LeBron, maybe there is something that I haven't seen, but what I have he can't shoot for anything. Carmelo has a much better all-around game. If the Cavs are looking for someone to win the dunk contest ... they might of found they're guy, but to take them to the postseason, I think they would have to take Carmelo.""

On Darko:

&gt;Chad Ford, ESPN Insider: He's the real deal. He's really one of a kind. He runs the floor, handles the ball, shoots the NBA 3-pointer, plays with his back to the basket, so you can slot him in at the 3, 4 or 5. What sets Darko apart is his toughness in the post. You have to love a guy who has the footwork to spin by an opponent, but still prefers to lower a shoulder and bang. Fact is, Milicic plays in attack-mode at both ends of the floor. The more you push, the more he pushes back. He's got a great frame. He'll definitely get stronger. He'll have no problem holding his own in the post.

On D Wade, who wasn't even mentioned until the 10th pick:

&gt;Aaron in McLean Va., wants to know: ""Are the Wizards going to go after the best PG available Heinrich/Ridnour or take another scorer like Dwyane Wade?""

Some other Notes: Charlotte was operating with reduced cap its first couple of years. New York was top-2 every year from 01 to 10. Portland was also top-2 from 01 to 04. The Jazz actually finished with a winning record in 03-04. I find it hilarious that in the 2013 seeding, the team with the highest payroll (the Lakers) finished with the exact same record as the lowest payroll (Rockets) at 45-37. Dallas also paid highly for a first round exit in 07-08.

I did not expect New Orleans to be top-10 in payroll in both 14-15 (8th), 15-16 (10th), and 17-18 (6th).  For a team that has never paid the luxury tax in franchise history, that was surprising. And yet it still managed to outspend Golden State in 16-17 (by about 32k).

However, they have some highly paid role players and future picks. Package them together for Westbrook and go for broke. They can't rebuild, and they're not a free agent destination. There's no super team right now, the Raptors lost Kawhi, the East is up for grabs. 

For OKC, they've already moved on Paul George, it's very possible Westbrook can't get them into the playoffs this year. The picks Detroit could provide could be lottery picks if the (admittedly risky) experiment fails. The players they take back have shorter contracts than Westbrook. They can press the reset button for real and build a new team through the draft- something they're really good at.",I think the Pistons should go all in for Russell Westbrook,post

They would still be in SOCAL and be only a couple hours away from LA, so the LA allure would still be there for future free agents.","The Clippers should move back to San Diego as a last second, all-in push to sign Kawhi",post

MavicBackpack,t3_cab7e2,nba,"1. **Denver** = lots of depth, won't be load managing, not that injury prone, one of the best last year.  Jokic will be an MVP candidate.

2. **Utah** = a great team last year that got a lot better and will be a top defensive team, as well as a good shooting team. Look for Mitchell to be even better.  They will be scary good.

3. **LAC** = a great group of role players who made the playoffs last year and added Kawhi and PG. Should be in WCF but will load manage in the regular season, plus PG coming off of surgeries.  Wouldn't be surprised to see them fall in the 5-6 range because of managing loads, but a crazy good playoff team.

4. **LAL** = best duo in the game, AD will feast this year. Added a lot of good depth and will probably get Iggy. Will probably load manage their stars a few games, and needs to build chemistry. Will be a tough out in the playoffs, could see them in WCF with LAC. Will be hungry after a bad last season.

5. **Portland** = played extremely well last year and kept most of the team in tact, great chemistry, and added some solid pieces.  Could see them top 3 in regular season.

6. **Houston** = one of the top teams, but chemistry will be interesting to see after most of their team but Harden was on trade block and still could be. Harden will carry them, and they have played together for awhile. Put them at 6 but could be top 3. They should load manage Harden to be healthy for playoffs and may for a few games. They won't care about seeding, just making the playoffs healthy.

7. **Golden State** = Klay missing most of the year will impact their standings, but when he gets back, they will be easily competing for WCF. Losing Iggy and KD hurts a lot, but you can't count out playoff Curry, Klay, and Draymond.  Will be interesting to see how they incorporate DLo. Like Houston, won't care about standings, just making the playoffs healthy.

8. **Sacramento** = just missed out on the playoffs last year as a very young team. They have a lot of depth now and added solid veteran players.  One of the deepest teams in the league, they will be hungry.

9. **San Antonio** = I think this is the first year they will miss out on the playoffs in a long time.  They aren't bad at all, I just think there will be 8 better teams. They are older and might not be as hungry. Added Morris, but everyone else is the same for the most part.  Wouldn't be surprised if they sneak in though. Bringing back Murray too will boost them potentially to a 6 seed.

10. **New Orleans** = This team will be good and fun every night.  I just think they are too young and 2-3 years away from really competing for a top spot.  I'm expecting them to win 40+ games honestly.  Think Zion starts off slow and defers too much, then goes HAM after the all star break.

11. **Dallas** = If everything goes well: Luca breaks out, Porzingis is healthy and back to form, and a few key other guys step up, they *could* sneak into the playoffs.  But realistically, I just don't think they will be in it this year.  Porzingis is very injury prone and as good as Luca, I think he is still a few years away from carrying a team to the playoffs.  They will be fun to watch though and a tough team to win against in the regular season.

12. **Memphis** = people might be surprised I have them this high, thinking they will be 14, but I think they will play above expectations this year.  I think JJJ breaks out and Morant wins ROY. Valancunas is a solid 20/10 guy at center and if they get some shooters, they will steal some games from contenders this year in the regular season, from being overlooked as a coast game.

13. **Minnesota** = KAT is great, and I like some of their solid role players in Covington and Okoogie (sp?) but they just don't have the talent to make the playoffs.  They should honestly be tanking IMO.

14. **Phoenix** = surprised they aren't last?  I think Booker steps it up and takes a big leap, with Ayton improving and shoring up the middle. Rubio will add some much needed drive and kicks, and then surround them with shooters and defenders and they get more wins then last year.  Still not talented enough to beat other teams often, and a few players away from making noise, but fun to watch hopefully!

15. **OKC** = first off, I think Westbrook gets traded before the season starts. Obviously if he is not traded, they end up a lot higher.  My guess would be around 10-11.  But without Westbrook, they won't have any dynamic player, just role guys.  Adams, Gallinari, Shai, Schroder, and friends are extremely good role players and will still win some games.  HOWEVER, if and when Westbrook is traded, I expect a fire-sale to try and move guys like Schroder and Adams for picks.  It would be in OKC's best interest to absolutely tank at that point and load up on picks for a repeat of last decade.  They have obviously drafted extremely well in the past.  That is why I have them last.

thepadin,t3_cac446,nba,"Good day to you basketball aficionados

I was thinking about ways to improve the NBA regular season, which is currently an afterthought to the playoffs, and I’ve think I’ve come up with a brilliant solution to this problem that’s a win-win:

Get rid of those pesky playoff series

How would this incredibly complex solution work? Easy: the team with most wins after 58 games wins

-Yes, we’re also shortening the season so every team plays a home and away game against each other

But thats not all folks, because we are making the regular season EVEN GREATER. How? By demoting the three worst teams after the end of the season to the G-League. Also, the top teams from each country would qualify for a continental, year long tournament (we could call it the Champions League)

-This system would have many advantages, like making sure that James Dolan isn’t the owner of an NBA team for long or ensuring that Toronto always makes the Champions League

I know your minds are already blown, but we’ve got even more changes incoming!

First of, to signal this absolute paradigm shift, I think we should seriously consider changing the names of our teams. I’ve been thinking about this for a while and I’ve come up with a few great ideas:

- Real Madrid
- Chelsea
- Juventus
- FC Barcelona
- Arsenal
- Bayern Munich
- LA Galaxy
- Borussia Dortmund


For the longest time I was satisfied with these changes, but after thinking about it, I don’t believe that basketballs pedestrian rules are fitting for the magnificent league that we’re building, so why not overhaul everything?!

So after really putting my mind to it, I’ve completely revised NBA rules to make them much better. If you guys want I can make another post about them, but I’ll give you a sneak peak right now: the players would play with their feet, not their hands, on a much, MUCH, larger pitch!

I know this is a revolutionary idea, but I’ll give an example for the nephews that don’t get it: Imagine an amazing Lebron James dunk, it would be just like that for the whole game, only that instead of dunking, Lebron an AD would exchange midfield passes for 90 minutes (obviously games would be longer to allow for more awesomeness)

Finally, I think that we should change the name of the game to reflect just how cool it is. I think the community should decide that, but I humbly propose that we call it r/nbaball
